I have this unique concept for a game that blends the intense action of a first-person shooter with the strategic depth of a real-time strategy game. The game is set in a futuristic world where various factions compete for global dominance. In this game, your focus is not just on shooting but also on constructing support structures and vehicles crucial for your path to world domination. This blend of action and strategy will appeal to gamers who enjoy both genres, offering a unique and immersive gaming experience.

For example, one of the unique features of the game is the ability to construct various structures that provide strategic advantages. You could have a constructible wall that provides shelter when you think you are working from somewhere, or you could have combat drones that shoot from a higher angle, so the walls need to be higher if you don't want to get shot. On the other hand, you can then have anti-drone defenses that shoot little rockets at the drones to make them go away. These unique gameplay elements add depth and variety to the game, making each match a unique strategic challenge.

What I like about this concept is that it's both a first-person shooter, so people who are good at clicking heads can enjoy that, and also more of a real-time strategy game, where you need to identify what kind of stuff is over at the other side and build appropriate countermeasures so that you aren't overrun with, for example, combat drones or artillery fire.

For this to work, it must be a larger play space with many people. However, you also need a way to concentrate the people so that nobody is at the corner of the edge, just defending nothing because everybody is in the middle.

Here are some examples of things that I already thought up so you could have rank. I already set combat drones that shoot from afar, but they don't need those can be air-to-ground or air-to-air combat drones, or they can be surveillance drones, and then to combat that, you can have anti-air missiles that shoot down the drones, and to combat that,  you can have sacrificial drones that just hit the missiles so that hit those, Оr the missiles hit those drones

You can create some cover, so you don't need to cross it all simultaneously. I was thinking about maybe plasma shields where all of the bullets that are fired can't penetrate the plasma shield. The significant advantage is that enemies can't hit you, but also the problem is that you can't fire from within the plasma shield. So you need to have some things that shoot outside the plasma shield. Then I was also thinking about little sentries. That is just a small robot that alerts you when somebody is near. I was also thinking about little walking robots, and those walking robots are there to deliver either a payload or shoot. You can also have a Team Fortress 2 teleporter.

 We need some gold mines or supply stores on the map.
If you cover more of the map, you will get more resources, allowing you to create more buildings. This will make you a more overwhelming force and allow you to end the game.

In conclusion, the game would combine building support buildings and shooting yourself. In the beginning, you come out shooting yourself, and then the more you progress, the more damage you do. I had two little logs.

That is my idea for a shooter RTS. I hope somebody has time to make it.
