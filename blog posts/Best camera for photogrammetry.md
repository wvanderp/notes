The best camera is the one you have with you. But I have several cameras at home.

I have a:

- Canon 80D
- Sony HX99
- Google Pixel 7 Pro

In this article, I will compare the three cameras and see which one is the best for photogrammetry.

# Technical specifications

|---|---|---|---|
| Name | Canon 80D | Sony HX99 | Google Pixel 7 Pro |
| Resolution | 6000x4000 | 4896x3264 | 4080x3072 |
| MPX | 24 | 18.2 | 12.7 |
| Sensor | APS-C | 1/2.3" | 1/1.31" |
| Lens | Various | 24-720mm | 24mm |
| Aperture | Various | f/3.5-6.4 | f/1.85 |
| RAW | Yes | Yes | No |
| GPS | No | No | Yes |

On paper, the Canon 80D is the best camera. It has the highest resolution, the largest sensor, and the most lens options. The Sony HX99 is a compact camera with a large zoom range. The Google Pixel 7 Pro is a smartphone with a good camera.
So it's still anyone's game.

# Image quality

| HX99                                 | Pixel 7 Pro                          |

You see this nonexistent noise pattern throughout the sign that is not there on the Pixel.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| HX99                                 | Pixel 7 Pro                          |

The HX99 did not manage to create a sharp image while walking, while the Pixel does.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| HX99                                 | Pixel 7 Pro                          |

Note the noise in the image of the HX99.

## Zoom

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| HX99                                 | Pixel 7 Pro                          |

You can see that the HX99 shines when we zoom in, being able to capture the grid pattern on the sign.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| HX99                                 | Pixel 7 Pro                          |

Further away, the bricks lose some definition.

## Conclusion

At its best, the HX99 is better than the Pixel 7 Pro. But the Pixel 7 Pro is more consistent.
You see the difference in resolution between the two cameras; the Pixel crop is consistently smaller than the HX99.
