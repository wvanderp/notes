# year of me

this theme exist of two parts:

- being more egotisitical in my life (in the good way)
- working on myself

i always give a lot and expect little in return. this year i want to express my needs and get them met.

part of getting my needs met is knowning what my needs are. so i will also be working on my self to get to know myself better.

I talked at work about not feeling great at work and they are sending me to a performance coach. Hopefully this is a great first step on my new theme.

I was also thinking about picking up swimming near my new job or at the revoeera bad in Spijkenisse.
