# year of me

This theme exists in two parts:

- being more egotistical in my life (in a good way)
- working on myself

I always give a lot and expect little in return. This year, I want to express my needs and get them met.

Part of getting my needs met is knowing what my needs are. So, I will also work on getting to know myself better.

### **2023-12-22 frighday before Christmas**

I talked at work about not feeling great, and they are sending me to a performance coach. Hopefully, this is a significant first step on my new theme.

I was also thinking about swimming near my new job or at the Het Riviera Bad in Spijkenisse.

### **2024-01-04**

It might be a good idea to talk more about myself.
