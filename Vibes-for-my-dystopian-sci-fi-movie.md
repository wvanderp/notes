# Vibes for my dystopian sci-fi movie

## Visuals

One of the vibes important to this movie is conflict. So one of the themes can be progressive vs. conservative. Do we lean into technology or humanity, and what happens when one side dives into the other domain?

there are a few awesome concepts in this video clip. like the same mysterious entity reoccurring in many historical settings. the way the color red highlights the presence of this entity.

every shot is the most best version of the shot. there is movement, cool visuals and a story in every shot.
