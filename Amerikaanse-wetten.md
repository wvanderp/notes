## Constitutional amendments

### First Amendment

>> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

In dit amendment is vast gelegd dat de overheid geen wetten mag maken die de vrijheid van religie, vrijheid van meningsuiting, vrijheid van de pers, vrijheid van vreedzame vergadering en het recht om de overheid te vragen om iets te veranderen, beperken.

in Nederland is dit op drie plekken vastgelegd:

* [Artikel 7 van de Nederlandse Grondwet](https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0001840&hoofdstuk=1&artikel=7&z=2023-02-22&g=2023-02-22)
* [artikel 10 van Europees Verdrag voor de Rechten van de Mens](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0001000/2021-08-01#:~:text=Article%2010.%20%2D%20Freedom%20of%20expression)
* [Artikel 19 van de Universele Verklaring van de Rechten van de Mens](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=worship%20and%20observance.-,Article%2019,-Everyone%20has%20the)

hierbij word artikel 10 het meest gebruikt in de rechtspraak.
