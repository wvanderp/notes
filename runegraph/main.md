# runeGraph

runegraph is a data collection and visualization project for the [oldschool runescape](http://www.runescape.com/). It uses an runelite plugin to collect data from the game and a web app to visualize it. The project is still in its early stages, but the data collection is already working and the web app is being developed. The project is open source and can be found on [github](https://github.com/wvanderp/runegraph).
