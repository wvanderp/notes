The kpop super live was a concert to make up for the desasterus ending of the world scout jamboree. The concert was held in the Seoul World Cup Stadium where all 50000 scouts were invited to attend.

they closed off most of the roads around the stadium to act a bus parking because all the scouts were bussed in from the places they were sheltered.
