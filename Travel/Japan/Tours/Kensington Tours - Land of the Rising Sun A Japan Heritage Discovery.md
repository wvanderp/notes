## Explore with an Expert

This morning, enjoy time at leisure to explore at your own pace, or relax at your hotel.

This evening, you'll meet our local ramen-expert at your hotel and set out for a night of discovery and discernment for this seemingly humble meal. Born in Tokyo, and raised on ramen, tonight you are paired with our go-to expert in Tokyo for this world-famous delicacy. Tonight, you will head to two, top recommended ramen shops and you will be able to enjoy four, mini-bowls of steaming hot ramen. Your guide will be happy to share their passion for noodles with you and explain why these particular restaurants are, in their opinion, some of the best in town as different cooking and serving styles, different ambiences and techniques are highlighted. You'll soon find no two ramen shops are the same -- they all have a specialty whether it's the deep flavor of their broth or texture of the noodles.

*Note: Please let your Destination Expert know should you have any dietary restrictions or are vegetarian. Accommodations can be made where possible. The tab for your first round of drinks is covered in the tour -- additional drinks or snacks are to be paid for on the spot.*

# Day 3: Tokyo

![Yokohama](image-link)

## Sights and Insights

Travel by train from Tokyo to tour [[Yokohama]]'s most attractive spots and uncover its fabled history. Start with [[Yamashita Park]], a public park that stretches along Yokohama's waterfront. Strolling through Yamashita Park, it is hard to miss the massive historic ocean liner beside the promenade. The ship is called the [[Hikawamaru]], and it was first put into service in 1930 along the Yokohama-Vancouver/Seattle line. The ship had first-class cabins that attracted the likes of the imperial family and Charlie Chaplin for their Trans-Pacific journey. Next, gain insight into Yokohama's past at the [[Japanese Overseas Migrant Museum]]. Over 25 million Japanese have migrated overseas since the 1860's and the museum showcases the chronological history of migration through literature, photos, and videos. After the museum, enjoy lunch within the city center.

Continue to [[Motomachi shopping street]], which runs parallel to the Nakamura River. The street served the needs of the first foreign residents of Yokohama, and it is here where many novel products were introduced to Japan. Nowadays the street does not differ drastically from other shopping streets, but it still has a certain European feel. There is a large number of high-end fashion shops, as well as cafes and restaurants. Passing through Motomachi Area, the tour leads you up to [[Yamate]] area, which retains many sites relating to the history of Westerners in Yokohama. Present day Yamate is still for the most part a hilly residential area with pleasant parks scattered throughout. The largest is the [[Minato no Mieru Oka Park]], from where you may admire the bustling harbor and the impressive [[Yokohama Bay Bridge]]. On the park grounds, one can also find some of the area's preserved western buildings. Mostly former residences, they are open to the public and offer a glimpse of the original style furnishings. Finally, reach [[Minato Mirai]], where you will journey to the top of the [[Landmark Tower]], Yokohama’s tallest building, for a spectacular view of the city and beyond.

# Day 4: Tokyo to Kiso Valley

![Kiso Valley](image-link)

## A Change of Scenery

Today you will leave the bustling capital behind and make your own way to [[Kiso-Fukushima]] in [[Kiso Valley]], the gateway to the [[Nakasendo Way]].

With provided tickets, board a Shinkansen train traveling from Tokyo to Nagano. In Nagano, you will change to a limited express train taking you to Kiso-Fukushima. The total journey time is three hours and 30 minutes.

The Kiso Valley is located in Nagano Prefecture and runs alongside the peaks of the Central Alps. An ancient 43-mile (70 km) trade route called the [[Kisoji]] was developed along the valley and served as a very important means of commerce in the area.

The Kisoji became even more significant from the beginning of the Edo Period when it was amalgamated with other routes in the formation of the 310-mile-long (500 km) [[Nakasendo]]. The Nakasendo ("path through mountains") was one of the two means of transportation between Edo and Kyoto. It contrasted with the other principal route of that period, the [[Tokaido]], which ran along the seashore. Because of restrictions by the shogunate, travelers were almost always forced to make their trips on foot. As a result, "post towns" developed every few miles to provide travelers with places to rest, eat, and find nightly accommodation during their arduous journey. Along the Kiso Valley, a few post towns, particularly [[Magome]], [[Tsumago]], and [[Narai]] have been preserved to look as they did when they served travelers of the Nakasendo. Contemporary visitors are now able to enjoy the stone paths and wooden buildings of a bygone era.

Before being transferred to your ryokan in Kiso Valley, you will have some time for self-guided exploration of the charming town of Kiso-Fukushima.

Upon arrival at Kiso-Fukushima, make your way to the [[Kiso-ontake tourism office]] in front of the station. Local staff will give you a short orientation about the area (including the train/bus schedule and the meeting point for tomorrow's guided tour). Entry tickets to historical sites and maps will also be provided. You can leave your luggage here until check-in.

With the provided entry ticket, you will be able to visit three fascinating sights in Kiso-Fukushima at your leisure.

We suggest that you first stop by the [[Yamamura Residence]] - the former home of the Owari clan's leader Yamamura, who was also known as the overseer of the Kiso-Fukushima area. Today the building houses a museum chronicling the upper-class life in Kiso-Fukushima.

Next, head to the lovely [[Kozenji Temple]], home to Asia's largest dry rock garden. Its beauty rivals even that of some of the dry rock gardens found across Kyoto. Finally, visit the [[Fukushima Sekisho-Ato]], a 270-year-old immigration office.

After your self-guided excursion, a hotel shuttle bus will pick you up at Kiso-Fukushima station between 4-5 pm, or you can make your own way to the hotel directly.

# Day 5: Kiso Valley

![Magome](image-link)

## Take to the Trails

This morning, make your way to Kiso-Fukushima station at around 8:45 am. There, you will meet your guide and take a short limited train ride to the town of [[Nakatsugwa]]. From there you will take the bus to [[Magome]], a former post town with buildings faithfully reconstructed in a traditional style. You will have some time to explore the town and make your way to the day's main event - the [[Nakasendo Way]].

With your guide by your side, hike the 5-mile stretch from Magome to [[Tsumago]]. The trail is a little steep at first but evens out quickly and slopes away gently to Tsumago. There are plenty of rest stops along the way. As you cross the forest, you'll be treated to views of cascading waterfalls and beautiful mountain vistas peeking through the trees.

At the end of your walk, your reward is the picture-perfect town of Tsumago. Unlike Magome, the homes here are all over 200 years old and still house many residents to this day. Step back in time as you explore this quaint settlement with your guide.

At 4 pm, a private transfer awaits to take you back to Kiso-Fukushima - a journey that takes just under an hour. Your guide will leave you back at your hotel.

# Day 6: Kiso Valley to Kyoto

![Fushimi Inari Shrine](image-link)

## Onward and Upward

Sadly, the time has come to bid farewell to the mountains of the Kiso Valley. You will take a limited express train from Kiso-Fukushima to Nagoya, and then the Shinkansen from Nagoya to Kyoto. Total journey time is around three hours.

Meet your guide for a train station transfer with a private vehicle.

With the expert insight of a private guide, begin today with a visit by taxi to the historic [[Fushimi Inari Shrine]], dotted with thousands of iconic torii gates. Established in the 8th century, it is one of the most iconic and visited religious sites in Japan. What sets Fushimi Inari Shrine apart is its thousands of vibrant red

 torii gates that create a captivating tunnel-like path leading up the forested [[Mount Inari]]. Follow these winding paths through the lush forest, making their way to the summit, where you can enjoy panoramic views of Kyoto. The shrine is dedicated to Inari, the Shinto deity of rice, prosperity, and business, and it attracts pilgrims and tourists alike, offering a unique blend of natural beauty, cultural significance, and spirituality. Next, it's on to [[Sanjūsangendō Temple]], the longest wooden structure in Japan. Inside is a transcendental experience as 1001 states of the goddess, Kannon stand at attention and have captivated visitors for centuries. Last stop: [[Kiyumizu-dera]], the famous Buddhist temple standing high up in the mountains of east Kyoto. The vantage point here is one of the most iconic photo opportunities from Japan, with a shot of 'Sanju-no-to,' (the Three-Storied red Pagoda), one of the must-sees in the city. The tour concludes with your guide returning you back to your accommodations.

## Strolling the Magical Streets

On this fascinating day tour in Kyoto, you will experience the traditional crafts that make Kyoto famous. First, journey to the eastern part of Kyoto, which is a famous pottery district. Here you will have the opportunity to make a pot by yourself. The pottery laboratory will then bake it and send it directly to your home! Next, visit a [[Yuzen Gallery]]. Yuzen is the method of dying Kimono. At the Gallery, you will be able to try your hand at Yuzen dying as well, and keep your work of art as a souvenir. After a traditional “bento box” lunch, you will visit [[Nijo Castle]], the 17th century ornamental castle built for a shogun, and a UNESCO World Heritage site. To conclude the day, you will walk through [[Nishiki Food Market]], which will mesmerize you with a lot of stands for traditional Japanese food. Finally, visit [[Gion]], the famous geisha district, where if lucky you will be able to see Geisha as they hurry to their first appointment of the evening. At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel.

# Day 8: Kyoto

![Hyatt Regency Kyoto](image-link)

## A Journey Back in Time

Take a full-day tour to [[Nara]] today, a city with a history predating that of Kyoto. First, you will visit the beautiful [[Isuien Garden]], divided into two distinct parts that were built two centuries apart. The garden is a striking example of Japanese horticulture, borrowing the water from the [[Yoshikigawa River]] and then boasting a striking mountain backdrop of [[Mt. Wakakusayama]]. Next, take a wander through [[Nara Park]], called ‘deer park’ by locals due to the large population of tame deer in residence. Within Nara Park find [[Todaiji Temple]], the world’s largest wooden building and home to Japan’s largest Buddha. Continue with a stop by Nara’s most celebrated shrine, [[Kasuga Taisha]], famous for its hundreds of bronze and stone lanterns donated by worshipers. To contrast the many temples and shrines you have enjoyed so far, end the day with a stroll around [[Naramachi]], a charming historic merchant district showcasing some exceptionally well-preserved ‘machiya’ Japanese townhouses. If you have some time to spare, a few of these beautiful houses offer free entry to give you a chance to peek inside and get a feel for traditional Japanese home architecture. Your guide will take you back to your hotel at the end of the day.

# Day 9: Kyoto to Hiroshima

![Himeji Castle](image-link)

## The Journey Continues…

Meet your guide for a train station transfer with a private vehicle.

Travel from Kyoto to Hiroshima by train with a day trip to the awe-inspiring [[Himeji Castle]]. This newly renovated iconic structure, nicknamed “Shirasagi-jo” (meaning “Castle of the white heron”), is arguably Japan's most spectacular castle for its imposing size. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the castle was never destroyed by war, earthquake, or fire and survives to this day as one of the country's twelve original buildings of this kind. After your exploration of Himeji, you will head to the nearby [[Kokoen Garden]], a beautifully manicured Japanese garden designed in the traditional style that offers spectacular views of nature throughout the year. Take a relaxing stroll along the garden's many paths while admiring its intricate yet natural design. Following your visit to the garden you will take a train to [[Tegara Station]], where you can enjoy a visit to [[Nadagiku Sake Brewery]] established in 1910. You are allowed to enter the old Sake cellar and will learn about the Sake distillation process before having a sample for yourself. Finally, board your train from Himeji onward to Hiroshima.

Your hotel is located directly opposite the Japan Rail train station. The walk from the train to your hotel is very short and easy. An assistant will greet you at the station and help you find the entrance to the hotel for your added convenience.

# Day 10: Hiroshima

![Hiroshima](image-link)

## A Healthy Dose of History

Your guide will meet you at your hotel to take you on a tour of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Miyajima]] by streetcar, train, and ferry. Start the day with a visit to the [[Peace Memorial Park]]. The area where the park now lies was ground zero for the Atomic Bomb on 6th August 1945. After the bombing, the Memorial Park was created and dedicated to those who lost their lives in the attack. Stroll through the park and discover the many memorials, monuments, and statues in the park before heading into the Museum itself. From Hiroshima, a short ferry ride will take you to [[Miyajima Island]]. A small sacred island located in the Island Sea, it has been a holy place of Shintoism since the earliest times. Here you will find perhaps the most photographed site in Japan - The [[Floating Torii Gate]]. Designated as one of Japan's '3 Most Beautiful Views', the shrine it belongs to dates back to the 6th century with the present structure dating back to the 12th century. The harmoniously arranged buildings reveal great artistic and technical skill, and have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Mere 'commoners' were not allowed to set foot on this holy place, and even now it is forbidden to give birth or die on the island! You will have time to explore the island and its many shrines and temples, sample local goodies like maple leaf-shaped cakes before heading back to your hotel.

Please note that with this tour you will have a private guide, but rather than traveling by private vehicle, you will make use of Hiroshima's efficient local transit system.

# Day 11: Hiroshima

![Kurashiki](image-link)

## A Walk Through the Past

With your private guide, board a bullet train and head east to the historic town of [[Kurashiki]] located in Okayama Prefecture. Kurashiki’s [[Bikan District]] showcases a unique blend of Japanese and western flavors, making it a perfect place to experience what life was like in this part of the country in the centuries past. In the Edo period, Kurashiki prospered as “Tenryo”, a domain directly governed by the shogunate. Special local wares from the surrounding areas were shipped to this vibrant town through a network of rivers, using [[takasebune]] cargo boats. Therefore, numerous whitewashed merchant homes and storehouses lined the river at the town’s center. Together with narrow stone-paved streets once crowded by carts, they make for a nostalgic depiction of the days gone by. Today, they house an eclectic collection of galleries and coffee shops. In the afternoon, you may choose between visiting the [[Ohara Museum of Art]] or [[Ohashi House]]. The Museum boasts the oldest private collection of Western Art in the country, including contemporary pieces from the West and Japan, as well as artwork created by the masters of the [[Mingei Movement]]. The Ohashi House stands as an example of Japanese merchant housing from the late 1700s. This luxury villa was once home to the wealthy Ohashi Family, who were so influential that some of the House’s architecture in fact resembles authentic samurai residences. Following your experience in Kurashiki, you will be accompanied back to your accommodation in Hiroshima.
