## Day 1 - UK - [[Tokyo]]

If you take an overnight flight to Tokyo you’ll enjoy more time to explore this fascinating city and its wealth of districts and subcultures.


## Day 2 - [[Tokyo]]

Tokyo is both modern metropolis and ancient capital rolled into one. Your Japan tour guide will provide an in-depth orientation to help you soak up the neon-bright atmosphere. Afterwards, retreat to the comforts of the [[Palace Hotel]], where many rooms overlook the [[Imperial Palace and Garden]].

### Pop culture in Tokyo

Spend the day with your savvy A&K guide who will help you discover Tokyo’s iconic pop culture. Start at a Japanese school in the city’s cool Nakano district where you can swat up on the history of manga. Then head to [[Nakano Broadway]], a four-level shopping mall dedicated to anime (animation).

You’ll then take the train to Harajuku and its lively pedestrianised [[Takeshita street]]. Here you’ll see colourfully-clad youths show off the latest in fashion and the quintessential kawaii (cute) culture. 

Continue to [[Akihabara]], Tokyo’s main district for anime, video games and wall-to-wall electronic goods. You’ll enter neon arcades full of virtual guitarists, teens on crane machines and people after work playing Pokémon. The area is also famed for its maid café where waitresses in maid’s outfits serve smiley-faced cupcakes and animal-shaped ice creams.

### Samurai sword making

Take a trip out to one of the oldest samurai sword workshops not usually open to the public. There are only 300 active swordsmiths in Japan and today you’ll enjoy insider access to the only one in Tokyo that practises this ancient craft. Your guide will pick you up and introduce you to Yoshindo Yoshihara, considered Japan’s swordsmith genius.

It takes over 10 years to become an expert swordsmith – learning every aspect of the craft from handling the iron to making the crest. Yoshindo will personally show you around his workshop where you can see methods handed down through family generations.

The samurai sword or _katana_ takes three months to make. Watch his apprentices work with the fragile _tamahagane_ steel, created by a traditional smelting process. See how the layers of steel are welded together ensuring strength and flexibility. Then learn how they curve and polish the swords, a process that can take up to three weeks to complete.

## Day 3 - Tokyo

You can start by exploring the traditional enclaves and futuristic streets on Tokyo’s excellent public transport. The contrast between the tranquility of the [[Meiji Shrine]] and the glitz of [[Omotesando]]'s fashion stores is pure Tokyo. It’s modern and tradition nestling cheek by jowl. Check out the themed cafes, maids, cats, anime and more , of Akihabara. Then finish in Ginza, Tokyo's most famous upscale shopping, dining, and entertainment district.

## Day 4 [[Tokyo]] - [[Hakone]]

A short journey to the mountain town of Hakone feels like a voyage to another world. [[Mount Fuji]] looms above the lake and hot springs are dotted amid the hills. A cable car will deliver you to the hot mountain springs where the hard-boiled eggs are said to add seven years to your life. Suitably rejuvenated you’ll sleep like a baby on the comfy futons of a traditional ryokan (inn) with exceptional views.

## Day 5 [[Hakone]] - [[Takayama]]

A final soak in an [[onsen]] (hot-spring bath) will set you up for one of Japan's most scenic rail journeys. The train meanders through mountains and gorges to reach the venerable city of Takayama. The Old Town is criss-crossed with narrow streets lined with Edoera merchant houses. Don't miss a visit to one of the many sake breweries. Hiccup!

## Day 6 [[Takayama]]

Take Takayama at your own pace. The [[Miyagawa morning market]] is ideal for browsing fresh produce, pickles and crafts. Take a peek inside the heritage houses, many of which are open to the public. Nearby, UNESCO-listed [[Shirakawago]] is a real glimpse of the past - a historic silk-farming village of thatched Gassho-style houses.

## Day 7 [[Takayama]] - [[Hiroshima]]

The views are fantastic as you descend the mountains by train to reach Hiroshima. The [[Peace Memorial Park]] was created on land destroyed by the atomic bomb in 1945. The skeleton of a building provides a poignant reminder of the city's past tragedies and its inspiring regeneration.

## Day 8 [[Hiroshima]]

A ferry will deliver you to sacred [[Miyajima]], known as Shrine Island. Itsukushima Shrine's torii gate seems to float on water, while the Five Tier Pagoda soars skywards. The slopes here are a riot of colour from cherry trees and maples in spring and autumn. Afterwards, a cable car up [[Mount Misen]] affords you magnificent sunset views over the islands of the Inland Sea.

## Day 9 [[Hiroshima]] - [[Kyoto]]

The Shinkansen bullet train will have you in Kyoto in no time. Japan's former capital is arguably its most intoxicating city. This is the place to get to grips with Japan’s unique culture. At the house of a Japanese tea ceremony master you can get to grips with the long history of this ritual, and you can also learn more about Zen Buddhism and the art of wearing a kimono.


## Day 10 [[Kyoto]]

Exploring Kyoto you may glimpse a geisha, wander down timeless alleys, peek into the temples, visit castles, admire gardens and rest under pavilions. [[Njio Castle]] is a must-see here, surrounded by stunning gardens, and the formal rock gardens of the [[Daitoku-ji Zen temple]] complex is perfect for relaxing in.

## Day 11 [[Kyoto]]

Today is at your leisure, we recommend a trip to [[Nara]]. Between 710 and 784 Nara was Japan’s capital, until it was moved to Kyoto. On your day trip here you’ll see [[Todaiji Temple]] which is the world's largest wooden building and home to Japan's largest Buddha. There’s also the delightful [[Kasuga Taisha]], Nara's most celebrated shrine, to visit before you return to Kyoto.

## Day 12 [[Kyoto]] to [[Tokyo]]

You'll have the morning free to spend as you wish before returning to Tokyo by train for an overnight stay.

## Day 13 Depart Tokyo

Transfer to the airport for your flight home.
