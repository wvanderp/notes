# Day 2: Kyoto

## Venture into the Outdoors
Today, together with a knowledgeable guide, you’ll head by public transportation to navigate cobblestone streets in neighborhoods that were established over 1000 years ago. You’ll find that Kyoto is not only a city steeped in history, but full of modern monks, artisans, baristas, and college students still working towards its lively future. [[Kinkakuji Temple]] draws millions of visitors each year, and you will quickly understand why this jewel in the northern hills of Kyoto is one of the country’s most visited sites. A far cry from Buddhist austerity, it is covered in real gold leaf, photogenically stunning at any time of the year no matter the weather. The story of the warlord who had this pavilion built will surely capture your mind, too. Next, stop by [[Ryoanji Temple]], which was built on the grounds of a villa of the Fujiwara clan in the Heian period (794-1185). The temple is home to one of the most famous zen rock gardens in Japan. Finally, visit [[Kitano-Temmangu]], a remarkable shrine to scholarship built to appease the spirit of an angry ghost. Buy a lucky pencil as local students do for their college entry exams, and then marvel at the surrounding entertainment district. After a fire in 1444, a large section of the temple was rebuilt, and the remaining timber was used to construct 7 tea houses that became the first ‘flower town’ or geisha district in Kyoto. [[Kamishichiken]] is every bit as charming as its more touristy cousin Gion, with the bonus of fewer crowds and excellent photo opportunities.

Please note: This tour makes use of Kyoto's efficient public transportation to travel around the city.

**Kyoto has been charming visitors to Japan since the country began opening its borders at the end of the 19th century. Once Japan's capital (794-868) and the emperor's residence from 794 to 1868, Kyoto is known throughout the world for its wealth of majestic palaces and villas, delightfully charming streets, tediously tended-to gardens, and time-honored traditions that are preserved to the present day.**

Options abound with time on your own in a city like Kyoto. This evening, consider walking the Philosopher's Path up to [[Higashiyama]]: This 30-minute (leisurely) walk takes you along one of the city's most iconic canals and is an ideal way to spend a languid afternoon. We recommend starting at the south end (unlike most city guides) so that your outing ends in the historical Higashiyama neighborhood, replete with dozens of cute cafes or boisterous izakayas if your afternoon walk has left your whistle in need of whetting.

## Hone Your Skills
On this fascinating day tour in Kyoto, you will experience the traditional crafts that make Kyoto famous. First, journey to the eastern part of Kyoto, which is a famous pottery district. Here you will have the opportunity to make a pot by yourself. The pottery laboratory will then bake it and send it directly to your home! Next, visit a Yuzen Gallery. Yuzen is the method of dying Kimono. At the Gallery, you will be able to try your hand at Yuzen dying as well, and keep your work of art as a souvenir. After a traditional “bento box” lunch, you will visit [[Nijo Castle]], the 17th-century ornamental castle built for a shogun, and a UNESCO World Heritage site. To conclude the day, you will walk through [[Nishiki Food Market]], which will mesmerize you with a lot of stands for traditional Japanese food. Finally, visit [[Gion]], the famous geisha district, where if lucky you will be able to see Geisha as they hurry to their first appointment of the evening. At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel.

# Day 4: Kyoto

## Refine Your Palate
Refine your palate as you venture to [[Uji]] with a private guide, discovering a traditional town that's renowned for its rich history and superior green tea. While Kyoto is believed to be the original site of tea cultivation in Japan, however Uji rose to prominence in the 12th century, gaining recognition for its superior quality. After a brief, 20-minute train taking you directly from Kyoto into Uji, you'll dive right into local tea culture with a hands-on tea making experience. With your guide translating the Uji residents, you'll either roast hojicha or grind matcha, depending on the season. Regardless of the tea you’ll be preparing, you’ll get to enjoy a freshly brewed cup of it afterward, a rewarding conclusion to the experience. Afterward, stroll through the picturesque town, with ample opportunity to casually sample tea from local shops - an activity many in Japan come to Uji to partake in. Nearby, another icon of Uji comes into prominence as you visit the UNESCO-listed [[Byodo-In Temple]], a stunning Buddhist temple and gardens dating back to the 10th century. Conclude your experience with a return transfer to your accommodation.

## Like a Speeding Bullet
Your guide will meet you at your hotel to take you on a tour of Hiroshima and [[Miyajima]] by street car, train, and ferry. Start the day with a visit to the [[Peace Memorial Park]]. The area where the park now lies was ground zero for the Atomic Bomb on 6th August 1945. After the bombing, the Memorial Park was created and dedicated to those who lost their lives in the attack. Stroll through the park and discover the many memorials, monuments, and statues in the park before heading into the Museum itself. From Hiroshima, a short ferry ride will take you to [[Miyajima Island]]. A small sacred island located in the Island Sea, it has been a holy place of Shintoism since the earliest times. Here you will find perhaps the most photographed site in Japan - [[The Floating Torii Gate]]. Designated as one of Japan's '3 Most Beautiful Views', the shrine it belongs to dates back to the 6th century with the present structure dating back to the 12th century. The harmoniously arranged buildings reveal great artistic and technical skill and have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Mere 'commoners' were not allowed to set foot on this holy place, and even now it is forbidden to give birth or die on the island! You will have time to explore the island and its many shrines and temples, sample local goodies like maple leaf-shaped cakes before heading back to your hotel.

Please note that with this tour you will have a private guide, but rather than traveling by private vehicle, you will make use of Hiroshima's efficient local transit system.

# Day 7: Hiroshima to Naoshima

This morning make the 150-minute journey by train to [[Okayama]] with your guide. You will be met in Okayama by a car that will take you to [[Uno Port]], where you will ride the ferry to [[Naoshima]].

Spend the day exploring the island. [[Honmura]], a small port town on Naoshima's eastern coast, is home to the [[Art House Project]], a collection of abandoned houses, workshops, a temple, and a shrine that have been converted into art installations and venues for contemporary art by artists and architects from Japan and abroad. The art houses are scattered throughout town, and most of them are unassuming from the street, blending into the surrounding traditional Japanese neighborhood. The interior of each, however, has been given over to artists to convert into whatever suits their artistic vision.

The [[Chichu Art Museum]] is a unique modern art museum built into a hillside overlooking the southern coast of Naoshima. The museum building, designed by Ando Tadao and itself a work of art, is mostly located underground and solely utilizes natural light to illuminate the artwork. This creates a viewing experience that is heavily influenced by the surrounding natural environment. There are many other smaller art installations and museums around the museum which your guide will be happy

 to show you.

Tonight, have dinner at [[Benesse House]]’s renowned French restaurant.
