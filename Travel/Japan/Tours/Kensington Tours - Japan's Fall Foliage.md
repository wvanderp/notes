At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel.

## Cross an Item off the Bucket List

# Day 4: Tokyo to Kyoto

## A Town Frozen in Time

Meet your guide for a train station transfer with a private vehicle.

Board a train from Tokyo with direct service to Kyoto. The train ride is approximately 2.5 hours.

Your hotel is located within walking distance to the Japan Rail Kyoto Station. The walk from the train to your hotel is quite short and simple, but for your added comfort, an assistant will greet you at the station and help you find the entrance to the hotel.

Today, together with a knowledgeable guide you’ll head by taxi to navigate cobblestone streets in neighborhoods that were established over 1000 years ago. You’ll find that Kyoto is not only a city steeped in history but full of modern monks, artisans, baristas, and college students still working towards its lively future. [[Kinkakuji Temple]] draws millions of visitors each year, and you will quickly understand why this jewel in the northern hills of Kyoto is one of the country’s most visited sites. A far cry from Buddhist austerity, it is covered in real gold leaf, photogenically stunning at any time of the year no matter the weather. The story of the warlord who had this pavilion built will surely capture your mind, too. Next, stop by [[Ryoanji Temple]], which was built on the grounds of a villa of the Fujiwara clan in the Heian period (794-1185). The temple is home to one of the most famous zen rock gardens in Japan. Finally, visit [[Kitano-Temanngu]], a remarkable shrine to scholarship built to appease the spirit of an angry ghost. Buy a lucky pencil as local students do for their college entry exams, and then marvel at the surrounding entertainment district. After a fire in 1444, a large section of the temple was rebuilt, and the remaining timber was used to construct seven tea houses that became the first ‘flower town’ or geisha district in Kyoto. [[Kamishichiken]] is every bit as charming as its more touristy cousin [[Gion]], with the bonus of fewer crowds and excellent photo opportunities.
