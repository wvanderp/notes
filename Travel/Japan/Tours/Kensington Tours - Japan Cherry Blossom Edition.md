# Day 2: Tokyo

## Sights and Insights
Spend a half day discovering Tokyo’s fascinating sites that juxtapose traditional temples and gardens with futuristic skyscrapers. With the help of your local guide, set out on the city’s comprehensive and user-friendly public transport system. Head to [[Asakusa]], the city’s old town area. Soak up the atmosphere of traditional Tokyo of yesteryear, exploring Tokyo’s oldest and most popular temple, [[Sensoji Temple]], also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple. Sensoji backs onto [[Nakamise]], a shopping street that has provided temple visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and souvenirs for centuries.

Hop on the subway for a journey across the city to the [[Meiji Shrine]], a shrine dedicated to the deified spirit of Emperor Meiji and a popular place for traditional Japanese weddings. Japan’s feudal era came to an end during the Meiji period, and the country found itself modernizing and westernizing during this time. If time permits, stroll along [[Omotesando]] shopping street, a broad tree-lined avenue home to the flagship stores of the world’s top fashion brands. At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel.

Please note that this tour includes a private guide. However, rather than traveling by private vehicle, you will explore Tokyo by making use of Tokyo’s efficient local transit system.

**After years of traveling to and from Japan, our Destination Experts all agree that when traveling to the other side of the globe, we all need some time at leisure to acclimate to the new time zone, a fast-paced city, and a different country, culture, and way of life. Take this day to explore the city at your own pace or rest at your accommodations and set off tomorrow fresh-faced and ready to take in the incredibly country that is Japan with your private guide alongside.**

Please note: If you're the type to 'hit the ground running' when you travel, simply let your Destination Expert know and they will help you choose the best tour for the first full day of your time abroad.

# Day 3: Tokyo

## Strolling the Magical Streets
This afternoon, explore three of Tokyo's vibrant centers of youth fashion and pop culture with your private local guide. Begin in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo's main center for youth fashion and culture. Its streets are the birthplace of many of Japan's fashion and entertainment trends, and the area is also home to the famous five-way [[scramble crossing]]. The Shibuya Crossing is rumored to be the busiest intersection in the world. Next, travel to [[Harajuku]] and [[Takeshita-Dori]] (Cat Street). This famous street is lined with quirky fashion boutiques, cafes, and restaurants for your enjoyment. Harajuku caters to every imaginable style and is the epicenter of Japanese “kawaii”, the culture of cuteness. Continue to [[Akihabara]], also known as Electric Town, an area that was originally famous for its many electronics shops. Akihabara is renowned as the center of Japan’s otaku culture, a culture of diehard fans in anime and manga fandom. Many shops and establishments devoted to anime and manga are now dispersed among the electronic stores in the district. At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel. Rather than traveling by private vehicle, you will explore Tokyo by making use of Tokyo’s efficient local transit system.

# Day 4: Tokyo to Hakone

## Breathe the Mountain Air
Leave behind the hustle and bustle of Tokyo in favor of a day in [[Hakone]], the gateway to Japan’s tallest mountain [[Mount Fuji]] and the surrounding national park. Your local guide will meet you at your hotel this morning and accompany you on your private drive from Tokyo. Spend the day exploring Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, making use of your private vehicle as well as Hakone’s experiential forms of transport. Ride the world’s second-longest cable car up [[Mt. Owakudani]], passing over sulfurous fumes, hot springs, and hot rivers in this active volcanic area. Sample Hakone’s famous local treat, the black eggs of Owakudani. The eggs are hard-boiled in Hakone’s well-known sulfuric hot springs, and local legend has it that eating one of these eggs will add seven years to your life. Board a majestic pirate ship and sail across [[Lake Ashinoko]], a lake formed by a volcanic eruption 3000 years ago. Throughout the day there is a chance to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji, however, please keep in mind that she is a notoriously shy mountain and it needs to be a clear day.

The [[Philosopher's Path]] is a pleasant stone path through the northern part of Kyoto's Higashiyama district. The path follows a canal which is lined by hundreds of cherry trees. Approximately two kilometers long, the path begins around [[Ginkakuji]] (Silver Pavilion) and ends in the neighborhood of [[Nanzenji]]. The path gets its name due to Nishida Kitaro, one of Japan's most famous philosophers, who was said to practice meditation while walking this route on his daily commute to Kyoto University. There are many small temples and shrines to stop off along the walk. At the end of the tour, you will be transferred back to your hotel.

# Day 6: Kyoto

## A Walk Through the Past
Today you’ll be exploring [[Arashiyama]], the western outskirt of Kyoto home to the world-renowned [[Arashiyama Bamboo Grove]] and the [[Nonomiya Shrine]], two of Japan’s most picturesque sites. A private guide will be accompanying you as you travel to and from the sites by taxi on this half-day tour. Stroll along the sprawling stalks of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, a serene and mystical forest that makes you feel like you’re walking in another world. Afterwards, you’ll visit [[Nonomiya Shrine]] where in ancient times, single imperial princesses stayed for a year or more to purify themselves prior to taking up their duties as royalty. Next, [[Okochi Mountain Villa]] is the former villa of the popular samurai film star Okochi Denjiro (1896-1962), and consists of several beautiful gardens and buildings, including living quarters, tea houses, and a zen meditation hall. Finally, you’ll visit [[Tenryuji Temple]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site ranked among Kyoto's five great Zen temples, and the largest and most impressive temple in Arashiyama. Tenryuji Temple is home to temple buildings, attractive gardens, and walking paths. Enjoy traditional Buddhist cuisine during a vegetarian "shojin-ryori" lunch made with yuba, tofu, and seasonal vegetables while overlooking the beautifully landscaped gardens. At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel.

**Enjoy a rare peak into Kyoto’s mysterious Geisha culture as you dine at a historical Kyoto restaurant, whose chef is the son of a Geisha. Enjoy a private multi-course traditional Japanese dinner, with the added chance to have a peak into the exclusive entertainments of the Kyoto “Flower and Willow World.” You will see an authentic maiko perform dances to live music by a senior geisha shamisen player. You will have the chance to partake in a traditional Geisha game, ask questions, and hear stories translated directly by your personal translator, an expert in Kyoto geisha culture who will help you every step of the way. This is a chance to partake in the elevation of human craftsmanship to a rarefied ideal in a unique ‘world within a world’ that even most Japanese find impenetrable. The evening ends at the restaurant, and your host can help arrange a taxi back to your hotel.**

# Day 7: Kyoto

## Nurtured by Nature
Begin your day by transferring from your hotel to [[Fushimi]] by taxi with your local guide. Fushimi is technically a part of Kyoto, and it is an area rich in history and charm. Upon arrival, visit [[Fushimi Inari Shrine]], which was used in the movie “Memoirs of a Geisha”. It is home to over 10,000 red tori gates, which form a path up the mountain behind the temple. After visiting the shrine, take a look around the [[Gekkeikan Sake Museum]]. During a tour of the museum, you will learn about the traditional brewing process and sample a small cup of sake if you wish. To enjoy even more of this Japanese favorite, visit a local café where your guide will order you a sake

 tasting set. There are a variety of sets to suit many tastes and you will be able to pick whichever appeals to you most. At the end of the tour, you will be transferred back to your hotel.

**Kyoto has been charming visitors to Japan since the country began opening its borders at the end of the 19th century. Once Japan's capital (794-868) and the emperor's residence from 794 to 1868, Kyoto is known throughout the world for its wealth of majestic palaces and villas, delightfully charming streets, tediously tended-to gardens, and time-honored traditions that are preserved to the present day.**

Options abound with time on your own in a city like Kyoto. This evening, consider walking the [[Philosopher's Path]] up to [[Higashiyama]]: This 30-minute (leisurely) walk takes you along one of the city's most iconic canals and is an ideal way to spend a languid afternoon. We recommend starting at the south end (unlike most city guides) so that your outing ends in the historical Higashiyama neighborhood, replete with dozens of cute cafes or boisterous izakayas if your afternoon walk has left your whistle in need of whetting.
