## Explore with an Expert
Spend a half day discovering Tokyo’s fascinating sites that juxtapose traditional temples with futuristic skyscrapers. With the help of your local guide, set out to explore the city in the comfort of your private vehicle. Begin with a visit to the city's oldest town of [[Asakusa]]. Soak up the atmosphere of the Tokyo of yesteryear, exploring Tokyo’s oldest and most popular temple, [[Sensoji]], also known as [[Asakusa Kannon Temple]]. Then move on to nearby [[Nakamise]] - a shopping street that has been providing temple visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks for centuries. Next, it's on to [[Meiji Shrine]], dedicated to the deified spirit of Emperor Meiji and a popular place for traditional Japanese weddings. Lastly, stroll along [[Omotesando]] shopping street - vastly different from Nakamise - a broad tree-lined avenue home to the flagship stores of the world’s top fashion brands. The adventure concludes with a drop-off at your hotel.

# Day 3: Tokyo to Hakone

![Lake Ashinoko](image-link)

## Nurtured by Nature
Leave behind the hustle and bustle of Tokyo in favor of a day in Hakone, the gateway to Japan’s tallest mountain [[Mt. Fuji]] and the surrounding national park. Your local guide will meet you at your hotel this morning and accompany you on your private drive from Tokyo. Spend the day exploring [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]], making use of your private vehicle as well as Hakone’s experiential forms of transport. Ride the world’s second-longest cable car up [[Mt. Owakudani]], passing over sulfurous fumes, hot springs, and hot rivers in this active volcanic area. Sample Hakone’s famous local treat, the black eggs of Owakudani. The eggs are hard-boiled in Hakone’s well-known sulfuric hot springs, and local legend has it that eating one of these eggs will add seven years to your life. Board a majestic pirate ship and sail across [[Lake Ashinoko]], a lake formed by a volcanic eruption 3000 years ago. Throughout the day there is a chance to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji, however, please keep in mind that she is a notoriously shy mountain and it needs to be a clear day.

# Day 4: Hakone to Kyoto

![Kinkakuji Temple](image-link)

## The Journey Continues…
Meet your driver for a train station transfer with a private vehicle.

Relax on the scenic train from Hakone's Odawara station to Kyoto. The train ride is approximately 2 hours.

Your hotel is located within walking distance of the Japan Rail Kyoto Station. The walk from the train to your hotel is quite short and simple, but for your added comfort, an assistant will greet you at the station and help you find the entrance to the hotel.

Today, together with a knowledgeable guide you’ll head by private vehicle to navigate cobblestone streets in neighborhoods that were established over 1000 years ago. You’ll find that Kyoto is not only a city steeped in history but full of modern monks, artisans, baristas, and college students still working towards its lively future. [[Kinkakuji Temple]] draws millions of visitors each year, and you will quickly understand why this jewel in the northern hills of Kyoto is one of the country’s most visited sites. A far cry from Buddhist austerity, it is covered in real gold leaf, photogenically stunning at any time of the year no matter the weather. The story of the warlord who had this pavilion built will surely capture your mind, too. Next, stop by [[Ryoanji Temple]], which was built on the grounds of a villa of the Fujiwara clan in the Heian period (794-1185). The temple is home to one of the most famous zen rock gardens in Japan. Finally, visit [[Kitano-Temanngu]], a remarkable shrine to scholarship built to appease the spirit of an angry ghost. Buy a lucky pencil as local students do for their college entry exams, and then marvel at the surrounding entertainment district. After a fire in 1444, a large section of the temple was rebuilt, and the remaining timber was used to construct seven tea houses that became the first ‘flower town’ or geisha district in Kyoto. [[Kamishichiken]] is every bit as charming as its more touristy cousin [[Gion]], with the bonus of fewer crowds and excellent photo opportunities.

# Day 5: Kyoto

![Arashiyama Bamboo Forest](image-link)

## Lose Yourself in Nature
Today, you'll head to the [[Arashiyama]] district, a pleasant area just northwest of Kyoto. Arashiyama has been a popular destination since the Heian period (794-1185), when nobles would relax in its peaceful setting. Take a walk through the famous [[Arashiyama Bamboo Groves]], which are particularly attractive when a light wind makes the tall bamboo stalks sway gently back and forth. This bamboo has been used at local workshops for centuries to create various products, such as baskets, cups, boxes, and mats, many of which exist in this area to this day. Visit [[Nonomiya Shrine]], a Shinto shrine where in ancient times, unmarried imperial princesses would stay for a year or more to purify themselves. Likewise, the stunning ground of [[Okochi Mountain Villa]] is the former villa of the popular samurai film star Okochi Denjiro (1896-1962). It consists of several beautiful gardens and buildings, including living quarters, tea houses, and a zen meditation hall. Here, enjoy some matcha tea and a light snack.

Lastly, visit [[Tenryuji]], ranked among Kyoto's five great Zen temples and the largest and most impressive temple in Arashiyama. Founded in 1339 at the beginning of the Muromachi Period (1338-1573), the temple is one of Kyoto's UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In addition to its temple buildings, there are attractive gardens with walking paths.

Embark your ship this afternoon in Tokyo.

Dense and delightful, there’s nowhere else like Japan’s kinetic capital - a city where ancient traditions blend seamlessly with a relentless pursuit of the future’s sharpest edge. See the city from above, as elevators rocket you up to towering viewing platforms, from which you can survey a vast urban ocean, interspersed with sky-scraping needles. Look out as far as the distant loom of Mount Fuji’s cone on clear days. Futuristic – second-accurate - transport seamlessly links Tokyo’s 14 districts, while the glow of flashing advertisement boards, clanks of arcade machines, and waves of humanity flowing along its streets, add to the sense of mesmerising, dizzying and glorious sensory overload. One of Tokyo’s most iconic sights, don’t miss the flood of people scrambling to cross [[Shibuya’s]] famous intersection. Join the choreographed dance, as crowds of briefcase-carrying commuters are given the green light to cross at the same time – bathed in the light of massive neon advertisements. The culture is immensely rich and deep, with 7th-century, lantern-decorated temples, stunning palaces and tranquil scarlet shrines waiting below cloaks of incense and nestling between soaring skyscrapers. Restaurants serve up precisely prepared sushi, and wafer-thin seafood slivers, offering a unique taste of the country’s refined cuisine. Settle into traditional teahouses, to witness intricate ceremonies, or join the locals as they fill out karaoke bars to sing the night away. In the spring, cherry blossom paints a delicate pink sheen over the city’s innumerable parks and gardens.

The [[

# Day 8: Osaka to Asia Cruise

![Osaka](image-link)

## Tastes and Traditions
Japan’s third-biggest city has thrown off its shackles and stepped out of the shadows to light up the sky with glaring neon signs and a larger-than-life outlook. Giant octopuses cling to buildings and bustling restaurants pack in the crowds in this great and garish place, which is Japan at its most friendly, extroverted, and flavorful. So dive in headfirst to experience an all-out sensory assault of delicious food, shopping cathedrals, and glittering temples. [[Dotombori Bridge]] bathes in the multicolored, jewel-like lights of signage-plastered buildings, and the neon lights dance on the canal's waters below. Osaka is known as the nation's kitchen, and the [[Kuromon Ichiba Market]] has served as the city's spot to tuck in for almost 200 years. Full of street food stalls - try pufferfish, savory Okonomiyaki pancakes, or ginger and onion-flavored octopus, among the endless feast of exotic flavors. [[Osaka Castle]] is another of the city’s landmarks, built in the 16th century by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. A modern museum now waits inside, where you can learn about the country's history, and why this castle is a symbol of Japanese unity. Be sure to take the elevator up to the observation deck for a panoramic view of Osaka's spread. A colorful park encloses the castle and blooms with an ocean of pale pink cherry blossom during the season - the elegant black tiers rising from the pink haze below is one of Osaka's most alluring visions. Kyoto’s peaceful cultural treasures and temples are also just a short jaunt away on Japan’s sleek trains, should you wish to explore further afield.

# Day 10: Hiroshima to Asia Cruise

![Peace Memorial, Hiroshima](image-link)

## A Journey Back in Time
History buffs will want to write home Hiroshima. Despite being devastated in 1945, this Japanese city is known to all for its commitment to peace – its ruin on the 6th August 1945 led to the end of the war and today, the [[Peace Memorial]] (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), is a constant reminder of the destruction that war brings. A walk in the leafy boulevards of [[Peace Memorial Park]] brings quiet contemplation. The [[Flames of Peace]] – set in the park’s central feature pond – burn brightly and will continue to do so until all the nuclear bombs in the world have been destroyed. There are many other inspiring messages of hope around the city too; the [[Children’s Peace Monument]] just north of the park is a homage to little Sadako Sasaki, who was just two in 1945. When she developed leukemia in 1956, she believed that if she folded 1,000 paper cranes – a symbol of longevity and happiness in Japan – she would recover. Sadly she died before she finished her task but her classmates finished the rest. If you are lucky enough to visit during the unpredictable and short-lived Sakura (cherry blossom) season, then the extraordinary sight of the delicate pink blossom floating across the water to the red gate, means you can consider yourself one of the luckiest people on the planet.

# Day 11: Fukuoka to Asia Cruise

![Fukuoka](image-link)

## Natural Beauty
Boasting Japan’s heady cocktail of hot springs, gourmet food, abundant nature, and spiritual history, Kyushu Island has all the advantages of the mainland, while enjoying its own identity. The island is the third largest of Japan’s five island provinces and prides itself on having everything you could expect from the Land of the Rising Sun. The capital of the island, [[Fukuoka]], is Japan in a bite-sized morsel. As one of the country’s most strategic ports – it is closer to Seoul than Tokyo – the city has enjoyed a somewhat prestigious status over the years, including two unsuccessful Mongol invasion attempts in the 13th century. Some scholars suggest that the city is also the first place the Imperial Family set foot, although actual proof of this is scarce. What is certain however is that it was once the home of the samurai, with many samurai-related spots found all over the city. A trip to the [[Kyushu National Museum]] will allow budding actors to try on traditional costumes and channel their inner feudal lord, while local shrines, tranquil Zen gardens, and castle ruins all offer a chance to relive the city’s glory days. The city itself is made up of two smaller towns (Fukuoka and Hakata), and despite unification in 1889, Hakata is still considered the center. A 2018 survey ranked the city number 22 on “the world’s most liveable cities” list, due to its excellent shopping, outstanding food, excellent transport links, good museums, “feeling of openness”, green spaces, and friendly, safe environment.

# Day 12: Busan to Asia Cruise

![Busan](image-link)

## Sights and Insights
A tapestry of kaleidoscopic colors, intense seafood flavors, and urban beach bliss, [[Busan]] rolls across a glorious natural setting on the Korean Peninsula's southeast. One of the largest and busiest ports in the world, 3.5 million people call South Korea's second city home, and the amiable locals help to lend the city its quirky, offbeat outlook. A spacious, playful, and cosmopolitan place, Busan is a lively, livable city, cradled by lush mountains and endless ocean scenery. [[Haedong Yonggung Temple]] nestles on a dramatic cliffside, just above the crumbling rocks and crashing waves of the East Sea. Dating back to 1376, the temple's multi-storey pagoda is adorned with lions - each representing a different emotion. Elsewhere, lanterns glitter in the night sky around [[Mount Geumjeongsan]], freshly released from the beautiful [[Beomeosa Temple]], which was established in AD 678. The hillside shantytown of [[Gamcheon Culture Village]] has completed an improbable transformation, blossoming from a sea of makeshift homes for Korean war refugees, into a colorful explosion of creativity and curiosity. Local artists have been let loose to create interactive installations, and the entire area is now an expansive canvas for expression. Lose yourself among vibrant alleyways of flamingo-pink, lemon-yellow, and baby-blue painted facades in this unique area. Sample [[bibimbap]], fiery-hot beef and rice, from street food vendors, before relaxing on one of South Korea's best beaches - [[Haeundae's]] banana bend of sand. Metallic skyscrapers offer an unusual backdrop to this pristine expanse of golden powder and are mirrored by elaborate sandcastles

 and sculptures during the annual sand festival - when spontaneous water fights and firework displays also take place. [[Gwangalli beach]] is another urban option, laying out spectacular views of the reaching Gwangan Bridge - the country's second-largest bridge. At night, 16,000 bulbs bathe this engineering marvel in color.

# Day 13: Nagasaki to Asia Cruise

![Glover Garden, Nagasaki](image-link)

## A Town Frozen in Time
Utterly devastated in just a few seconds, [[Nagasaki]] was the target of the second US atomic bomb, as World War II moved towards its horrifying conclusion. More than 50,000 were killed, and the stories here are harrowing and poignant. The fact that Nagasaki still stands at all, and has embarked on a new mission to promote global peace with a message of hope, is a testament to the people of this extraordinary place, however. The scars the city wears will never heal, but the color, culture, and creativity of Nagasaki may surprise you. Of course, the events of August 9th, 1945 are unavoidable, and the [[Atomic Bomb Museum]] pulls no punches in its rendering of the story. Hear from survivors, known as ‘Hibakushas’, who speak at the center, sharing tales of sadness, hope, and resilience. The [[Memorial Hall]] is a glass structure of meditation and messages of peace left by visitors from every corner of the world. [[Nagasaki Peace Park]] honors the victims, while the [[Hypocenter Park]] marks the explosion's epicenter. [[Suwa Shrine]] stands just 800 meters away, and you can see the iconic, one-legged torii which was photographed, miraculously still standing amid the sea of devastation. Look out for the temple's scarred trees, which somehow survived the blast too. Look out over the city, nestled in the undulations of the valley – as you reach the top of [[Mount Inasa]] - which actually served to protect and shelter Nagasaki from even more destruction. Up here, you can't help but consider the city's journey - as it spreads out before you. A ropeway or a bus will help you reach this spectacular vantage point, to observe the harbor glittering and glistening peacefully.

# Day 14: Kagoshima to Asia Cruise

![Kagoshima](image-link)

## Hidden Gems
One of Japan's most southerly major cities, [[Kagoshima]] is dominated by the imposing Sakurajima volcano's cone – a legendary active volcano that broods, churns, and puffs out ash nearby. A pretty old-time ferry chugs across the still waters to the gently sloping foothills of the volcano's cone, and it's easy to imagine where the comparisons with its sister city Naples materialized, as you sail the glorious sweeping [[Kinko Bay]], below beaming sunshine, towards the immense volcanic spectacle. This is certainly no historic relic, and the volcano remains revered and feared, with the most dramatic recent eruption taking place in 1914, and spewing out a new bridge of land into the sea. Make the most of the geothermal activity in the area by indulging in a stress-simmering black sand bath. Incredibly relaxing, you'll be submerged in the warm sand, as you feel your muscles relaxing in the heat, and rejuvenating blood pumping around your body. Enjoy a privileged view of the iconic volcano's loom from the terraced garden of [[Senganen Garden]]. Built in 1658, this elegant, traditional garden has belonged to the Shimadzu family for 350 years. Wander the gardens - which bloom with Japan's renowned cherry tree blossoms and feature tiny bridges looping over ponds and rock pools - before sitting back and sipping a wholesome green matcha latte. Elsewhere, museums offer Feudal Era and Satsuma Province history, as well as insights into the Kamikaze squadrons of World War II. [[Lake Ikeda]] is also close by, so be sure to keep an eye out for the legendary Issie monster.
