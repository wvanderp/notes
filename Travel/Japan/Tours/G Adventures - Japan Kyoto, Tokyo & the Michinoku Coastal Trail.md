# Day 1: Kyoto: A Cultural Capital

Once the capital city of Japan for over a thousand years, Kyoto now finds itself the cultural capital, if not the actual one. In its evolution, what Kyoto lost in title, it has more than made up for in culture, gastronomy, and charm. Your journey through Japan begins in this unforgettable former capital. Welcome to Kyoto, and to Japan, and we invite you to embrace your evolution. Like Kyoto, we only get better with age.

Arrive at any time and choose to join your CEO on a brief walk to stretch your legs after a long flight. Join your CEO for dinner at the hotel.

# Day 2: Kyoto: Kitayama Villages Hike

The [[Kitayama]] mountains border [[Kyoto]] on the north and juxtapose bustling [[Kyoto]] with their tranquil wooded pathways. The bright red Tengu, a physical statue of a supernatural spirit, is your starting point as you hike from village to village, exploring the forest and the cultural treasures within it.

Hike from [[Kurama]] village to [[Kibune]]—two villages that mark the start and endpoint of the hike. As you wind your way through the canopied forest, visit the [[Kifune Shrine]] and [[Kurama-dera Temple]]. Return to Kyoto for a CEO-led walking tour and visit to [[Chion-in Temple]].

### CEO-Led Hiking Tour from Kurama to Kibune - Kyoto (2h30m)

Transfer by train and subway to [[Kurama Station]] and begin your CEO-led hike. Walk between these two picturesque, quaint villages in the [[Kitayama Mountains]] and follow the stone steps up into the verdant, mist-shrouded forests. Pass through the highland and visit smaller temples and search for spring water outlets flowing down the trail. Stop along the way at the [[Kurama-dera Temple]]—located atop the mountain with stunning views of the countryside—and [[Yuki Shrine]].

**Meals included:** Breakfast

# Day 3: Lake Tazawa: Japan's Deepest Lake

Legend goes that Tatsuko, a girl known for her beauty, went to [[Lake Tazawa]] to search for the spring of eternal beauty. Upon taking gulp after gulp, she is turned into a dragon and is thrust into the lake. Her quest to find eternal beauty was left unfulfilled, but the beauty of [[Lake Tazawa]] remains, as stunning now as it was when Tatsuko drank from its shores.

Bullet train brings you from [[Kyoto]] northbound to the [[Akita Prefecture]]. Both exceedingly deep (Japan's deepest) and with a unique blue color, [[Lake Tazawa]] can be explored by kayak or by cycle today upon arrival. Choose your adventure this afternoon. Fountain of youth not guaranteed.

### Lake Tazawako Cycling - Tazawako-jindai

[[Lake Tazawa]] is Japan's deepest and clearest lake due to its naturally occurring acidity. It serves as a picturesque hub for outdoor water activities. Depending on weather conditions, either paddle out onto the lake on a guided kayak tour. Feel the peaceful calm as you float on the mesmerizing, unique emerald blue of the lake. Or alternatively, join your guide for a relaxing cycle around the lake with a view of [[Mt. Akita-Komagatake]], a beautiful volcano and the highest mountain in [[Akita Prefecture]].

### Bullet Train - Kyoto – Tazawako-jindai (5h-5h15m, 840km)

Get to your next destination faster than the speed of light (ok, maybe not that fast) aboard a high-speed train. First, take the bullet train from [[Kyoto Station]] to [[Tokyo Station]] where there will be a transfer to the next bullet train to [[Tazawako Station]]. Enjoy a Japanese bento lunch box on board, while you sit back and soak in the scenery whipping by.

**Meals included:** Breakfast | Dinner

# Day 4: Lake Tazawa: An Ode to Rice and Sake

Exploring this small part of [[Akita Prefecture]] feels as though you have been let in on a very good secret. Cherry blossoms, sake, and samurai may sound like familiar emblems of Japanese culture, but the day's explorations shed an entirely new light on what you thought you knew. Small samurai villages, friendly local people, and a stunning preservation of culture that invites you to slow down and take in what makes Japan truly unique.

Begin the morning with a local business run by the same family for generations. Their craft uses the bark of the cherry blossom to produce charming works of art. Build your own alongside the experts. Wander a samurai village at your own pace, making your own discoveries along the way. This early evening at the sake brewery begins with song and ends with a full stomach.

### Cherry Bark Craft Experience - Tazawako-jindai (1h30m)

The craft known as [[Kabazaiku]] has been passed down from generation to generation and is the only craft in the world that uses bark from wild cherry blossoms. When the bark is peeled using this technique, the tree will be able to regenerate in a few years and doesn't need to die in order for the bark to be used. Visit this family-run craft business and spend time in the workshop at their home. A common thread in [[Akita]] is an unspoken pledge to work in harmony with nature, sustainably using the local resources, and we invite you to join your local hosts and get your hands dirty on a cherry bark creation of your own.

### CEO-Led Visit of Kakunodate Town - Tazawako-jindai (1h45m)

After enjoying lunch at a local restaurant, the group will set out on the Samurai Street walk led by your CEO. Pass through [[Kakunodate Town]] famous for its samurai tradition and its abundance of weeping cherry trees. The town remains remarkably unchanged since it was founded in 1620. It was built with two distinct areas, the merchant district and the samurai district. On the walk, there will be an option to visit a [[Samurai House]] or to do some tasting of locally produced miso, and other delicious treats.

### Sake Brewery Visit - Akita (2h30m)

Visit a sake brewery and take a tour learning from the Suzuki family who has been making great sake for the last 330 years. Sit down for dinner and sake pairing with some delicious locally produced foods, and listen to stories from the 19th generation of Suzukis on the 2nd floor of the brewery in a traditional room. The tour includes an in-depth look into the brewing process as you see the facilities. See the establishment’s collection of art, samurai armor, and pieces of jewelry dating back to the 17th century. For all this time the fields of [[Akita]] have remained bountiful, the water crisp, making it possible to continue making sake the same way for centuries. Taste the warm, fruity flavors and sip a drink that has become an age-old tradition.

**Meals included:** Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner

# Day 5: Nyuto Onsen: Hot Springs in the Mountains

Just outside [[Lake Tazawa]] lies the village of [[Nyuto]]. Seven different [[Ryokan]] call [[Nyuto]] home, and one of these [[Ryokan]] is your resting place for the evening. This area is famous for its [[Onsen]], Japanese natural spring baths. Take time to enjoy the peace and tranquility of being far from the rest of the world while the warm spring water refreshes you from the outside in.

Before you can hop into the rejuvenating spring water, explore [[Nyuto]] village by e-bike on a guided tour. Far from the rush of places like [[Kyoto]] and [[Tokyo]], your experience in [[Nyuto]] invites you to explore rural Japanese life in a place not often visited by travelers coming to Japan.

# Day 6: Iwate: Fudai and a Story of Resilience

The Tsunami that hit the coast of Japan in 2011 devastated communities along the northeastern coastline. One village, however, was spared. [[Fudai]], in [[Iwate Prefecture]], is a place left untouched by western commercialism, and luckily, by the effects of the Tsunami. An incredibly bold, forward-thinking mayor initiated the building of a seawall that proved ominously prescient. Thanks to the seawall, centuries of tradition, culture, and history were preserved. Because of this, we have an extremely rare and unique opportunity to hike to an ancient shrine and witness a performance very few people on Earth have ever had the chance to see. Spend time in [[Fudai]] eating local Japanese delicacies, hearing from locals about their experiences after the Tsunami, and visit the seawall itself.

After your experience discovering the village of [[Fudai]], hike up to the [[Unotori Shrine]]. Witness a unique cultural performance that is closely connected to the traditional Japanese "nature worship". These performances are so rare that often many Japanese visitors are seeing them for the first time themselves. Conclude the day with a five-course meal at a French-inspired restaurant with locally sourced and produced ingredients.

The total length of the hike is 1.6km and has an elevation gain of 424m.

**Meals included:** Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner

# Day 7: Iwate: Michinoku Coastal Trail Trek

The [[Michinoku Coastal Trail]] is a story of community tourism. It's a story of building back better after a devastating loss. The trail itself offers unparalleled views of the blue ocean crashing into rocky sea caves. The day spent with local trekking guides and fishermen give a glimpse into local life here in [[Iwate]].

The trail stretches over 1000 kilometers from [[Hachinohe]] to [[Soma City]] in [[Fukushima]]. Spend the day trekking one of the most picturesque portions of the trail, traversing just over 9kms.

# Day 8: Tokyo: Jodogahama Beach

[[Jodogahama Beach]] looks like something slightly out of a scene from Star Wars—rock formations jutting straight out of the clear blue water. A six-minute walk brings you straight to the beach, with time for a swim or leisurely seaside walk. Bright and busy [[Tokyo]] is on the horizon, so breathe in that salty air while you can.

After a leisurely morning at the beach, relax on a bullet train to [[Tokyo]] throughout the afternoon.

### Jodogahama Beach Walk (1h30m, 2km)

Settle in and scan the scenery from the convenience of a private vehicle from [[Jodogahama]] to [[Morioka Station]].
