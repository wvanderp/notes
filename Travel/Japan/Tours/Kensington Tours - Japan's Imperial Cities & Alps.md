During the Edo Period, Kanazawa served as the seat of the Maeda Clan, the second most powerful feudal clan; Kanazawa grew to become a town of great cultural achievements, rivaling Kyoto and Edo (Tokyo). During World War Two, Kanazawa was Japan's second-largest city (after Kyoto) to escape destruction by air raids. Consequently, parts of the old castle town, such as the [[Nagamachi]] samurai district and chaya entertainment districts, have survived. Today, the city boasts many historical attractions such as restored residences and districts, as well as modern museums. A full day to explore Kanazawa with a local guide.
