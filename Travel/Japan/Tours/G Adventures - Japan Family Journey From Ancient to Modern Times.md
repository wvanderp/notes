## 11 days

# Day 1: Tokyo

Arrive in time to meet your fellow travelers for a welcome gathering this evening. Your arrival transfer is included.

On our tours in Japan we use public transport, making use of Japan's world-famous transportation system. From the super fast [[Shinkansen]] Bullet Train to Kyoto's extensive local bus network, we ride with the locals.

As well, there is a lot of walking on this trip, every day - please ensure you have an average level of fitness and can walk unaided for long periods of time. A good pair of walking shoes are highly recommended.

> **Note**: We will use a baggage transfer service, which is included in the cost of your tour, so you will not have to worry about carrying your bags on and off trains as we travel. As such, you will not have access to your bags during the transfers from city to city and will not be reunited with your luggage until the following day. On these days, we recommend using an overnight bag for anything you may need, including valuables.

### Luggage Size Restriction – Effective from May 2020 onwards

All G Adventures tours in Japan use the world-famous [[Shinkansen]] bullet trains, which have a restriction on maximum luggage size. Any luggage brought on board the train must be less than 160cm in total. This is roughly the size that most airline companies consider as "carry-on baggage" and allow in overhead storage compartments.

As this tour includes city-to-city luggage transfers, this restriction affects your carry-on luggage on board the train.

### Arrival Day and Welcome Meeting (1h)

The adventure begins tonight. Feel free to explore before your welcome meeting, but make sure you’re back in time to meet the group. Check for the meeting time on the welcome note at the hotel. After introductions, your CEO will review the details of your tour. Please note that normal check-in times apply at our start hotels, but you can usually store your luggage for the day if you arrive early.

#### Airport Transfer

**Narita International Airport – Tokyo**  
You will be transferred from the airport to your start hotel. Please note your arrival transfer is included from both Haneda and Narita Airports.
