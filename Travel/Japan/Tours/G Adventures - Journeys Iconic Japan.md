12 days

# Day 1 [[Tokyo]]

Arrive at any time.

On our tours in Japan, we use public transport, making use of Japan's world-famous transportation system. From the super-fast [[Shinkansen Bullet Train]] to [[Kyoto]]'s extensive local bus network, we ride with the locals.

As well, there is a lot of walking on this trip every day - please ensure you have an average level of fitness and can walk unaided for long periods of time. A good pair of walking shoes is highly recommended.

Please note: We will use a baggage transfer service, which is included in the cost of your tour, so you will not have to worry about carrying your bags on and off trains as we travel. As such, you will not have access to your bags during the transfers from city to city, and will not be reunited with your luggage until the following day. On these days, we recommend using an overnight bag for anything you may need, including valuables.

### Luggage Size Restriction – Effective from May 2020 onwards

All G Adventures tours in Japan use the world-famous [[Shinkansen Bullet Trains]], which have a restriction on maximum luggage size. Any luggage brought on board the train must be less than 160cm in total. This is roughly the size that most airline companies consider as "carry-on baggage" and allow in overhead storage compartments.

As this tour includes city-to-city luggage transfers, this restriction affects your carry-on luggage on board the train.

### Arrival Day and Welcome Meeting

**1h**  
The adventure begins tonight. Feel free to explore before your welcome meeting, but make sure you’re back in time to meet the group. Check for the meeting time on the welcome note at the hotel. After introductions, your CEO will review the details of your tour. Please note that normal check-in times apply at our start hotels, but you can usually store your luggage for the day if you arrive early.

### Accommodation

Below is an example of the hotel we may use in this city. For the actual hotel your specific departure will be using, please check your voucher.

# Day 2 [[Tokyo]]

In [[Harajuku]] we catch a glimpse of the pop culture phenomenon of Kawaii. Directly translated as "cute," this Japanese cultural movement is reflected through various avenues of entertainment, toys, personal style, attitude, and cuisine.

On some departures of this tour, the activities on Days 2 and 3 will be swapped.
