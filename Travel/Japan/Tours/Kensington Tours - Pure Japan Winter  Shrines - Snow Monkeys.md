## Get a Lay of the Land

Spend a half day discovering Tokyo’s fascinating sites that juxtapose traditional temples and gardens with futuristic skyscrapers. With the help of your local guide, set out on the city’s comprehensive and user-friendly public transport system. Head to [[Asakusa]], the city’s old town area. Soak up the atmosphere of traditional Tokyo of yesteryear, exploring Tokyo’s oldest and most popular temple, [[Sensoji Temple]], also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple. Sensoji backs onto [[Nakamise]], a shopping street that has provided temple visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and souvenirs for centuries.

Hop on the subway for a journey across the city to the [[Meiji Shrine]], a shrine dedicated to the deified spirit of Emperor Meiji and a popular place for traditional Japanese weddings.

# Day 3: Tokyo

## Secrets of the City

This morning, a guide will meet you at your hotel and take you to a "sumo beya" or sumo stable. There, you will have a peek behind the scenes at the world of sumo beya. All rikishi (wrestlers) belong to beyas, or sumo stables, where they live, train, and eat. You will be able to visit one of these heya to get up close and personal with these giant men and watch their asa geiko (morning training).

The day begins in the early morning, when the lowest-ranked men wake up and put in some practice before going about their assigned duties, which include cleaning the building and preparing the food for the main meal of the day. Higher-ranked sekitori appear at a more reasonable hour, and they begin a practice session that runs from about 7 am until about 10 am. After several hours of warm-up and technique practice, the wrestlers play an exciting "King of the Castle" game where one wrestler stays in the ring fighting bouts without any rest until he is defeated.

As the end time for training is in flux, the tour disbands at the stable. You will need to make your own onward arrangements.

Please note that you will have to sit on tatami matting. Seats are unavailable. Small children may not be allowed. Visitors are requested to observe absolute silence to not disturb the wrestlers.

This afternoon, explore three of Tokyo's vibrant centers of youth fashion and pop culture with your private local guide. Begin in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo's main center for youth fashion and culture. Its streets are the birthplace of many of Japan's fashion and entertainment trends, and the area is also home to the famous five-way [[scramble crossing]]. The Shibuya Crossing is rumored to be the busiest intersection in the world. Next, travel to [[Harajuku]] and [[Takeshita-Dori]] (Cat Street). This famous street is lined with quirky fashion boutiques, cafes, and restaurants for your enjoyment. Harajuku caters to every imaginable style and is the epicenter of Japanese “kawaii”, the culture of cuteness. Continue to [[Akihabara]], also known as Electric Town, an area that was originally famous for its many electronics shops. Akihabara is renowned as the center of Japan’s otaku culture, a culture of diehard fans in anime and manga fandom. Many shops and establishments devoted to anime and manga are now dispersed among the electronic stores in the district. At the end of the tour, you will be dropped off at your hotel. Rather than traveling by private vehicle, you will explore Tokyo by making use of Tokyo’s efficient local transit system.

# Day 4: Tokyo

## Breathe the Mountain Air

Today, leave Tokyo behind as you journey to nearby [[Hakone]] with your local, private guide. Hakone is considered one of the gateways to [[Mount Fuji]] and the surrounding national park, and a vacation destination for the Japanese noble class for centuries. After your arrival, you will take some time to explore the old town area (Moto-Hakone) on the lake shore. There are a number of things to see and do here that cater to various interests; whether that's history, art, or local artisanal specialties. Let your guide know what your interests are, and they will be happy to take you to attractions that match your interests. After lunch, you will travel across picturesque [[Lake Ashi]] by stylish cruise boat (shared). You will be able to see Mt. Fuji from the lake if the weather is clear. Next, you'll make your way up the [[Komagatake Ropeway]]. Again, if the weather is on your side, you can enjoy views of Mt. Fuji in the distance. The ropeway takes you to the summit of Mt. Komagatake, from which you can see amazing panoramic views of Lake Ashi, Hakone, and Mt. Fuji. Heading down the ropeway, you will pick up a cruise again across to Moto-Hakone before taking the road back to the station and catching your train back to Tokyo. Your guide will accompany you to your hotel.

*Note: Please be advised that Mt. Fuji is a notoriously shy mountain and the weather needs to be perfectly clear in order to see it in the distance.*

To avoid the hassle of taking public transportation, transfer to the park by a taxi included in the price of today's tour. Upon arrival, embark on a scenic, leisurely hike before reaching the entrance to the park.

Jigokudani means ‘hell’s valley’ due to the steam and boiling water that bubbles out of small crevices in the frozen ground, and it is in the baths of this boiling water that the resident Japanese Macaques like to soak in. The monkeys live in large social groups, and it can be quite entertaining to watch their interactions. Accustomed to the presence of people, the monkeys almost completely ignore their human guests and they can be observed from up close. While the monkeys are most numerous during the colder months, they can be seen all year round.

Please Note: The entrance to the park is located a 15-20 minute hike away from the closest point reachable by car. It is a leisurely hike with moderate to no slopes.

Never shying away from a theme, Matsumoto's themed 'Frog Street' is adorned with cute frog characters from the three dressed in Samurai suits welcoming you at the top of the street, to figurines in shops, to tayaki shaped like frogs. Lastly, visit the pleasant [[Yohashira Shrine]] nearby; Beautiful all year round but especially so in the fall and at New Year's.

# Day 8: Matsumoto to Kyoto to Nagoya

## Wasabi Wonderland

Today, get 'off the beaten path' and enjoy a truly unique experience: A visit to one of Japan's largest wasabi farms to learn about the notoriously, difficult-to-grow wasabi plant. After meeting your guide at your hotel, head to Matsumoto station by subway and then board the local train to the nearby town of [[Daio]], where wasabi production is renowned for the region. These days, much of what is sold in supermarkets and sushi restaurants is seldom the 'real deal' and is often cut with horseradish or mustard to fake the wasabi flavor. To visit Japan and try your hand at wasabi-making is a rare experience for visitors to the country. The [[Daio Wasabi Farm]] takes great efforts to ensure their wasabi plants are raised in only the best conditions to ensure they can provide the real article. Learn all about the process from seed to sushi-table and how Japanese farmers work hard to ensure quality states consistent with what is really an artisanal ingredient.

# Day 9: Kyoto

## Tastes and Traditions

Today, together with a knowledgeable guide, you’ll head by public transportation to navigate cobblestone streets in neighborhoods that were established over 1000 years ago. You’ll find that Kyoto is not only a city steeped in history, but full of modern monks, artisans, baristas, and college students still working towards its lively future. [[Kinkakuji Temple]] draws millions of visitors each year, and you will quickly understand why this jewel in the northern hills of Kyoto is one of the country’s most visited sites. A far cry from Buddhist austerity, it is covered in real gold leaf, photogenically stunning at any time of the year no matter the weather. The story of the warlord who had this pavilion built will surely capture your mind, too. Next, stop by [[Ryoanji Temple]], which was built on the grounds of a villa of the Fujiwara clan in the Heian period (794-1185). The temple is home to one of the most famous zen rock gardens in Japan. Finally, visit [[Kitano-Temmangu]], a remarkable shrine to scholarship built to appease the spirit of an angry ghost. Buy a lucky pencil as local students do for their college entry exams, and then marvel at the surrounding entertainment district. After a fire in 1444, a large section of the temple was rebuilt, and the remaining timber was used to construct 7 tea houses that became the first ‘flower town’ or geisha district in Kyoto. [[Kamishichiken]] is every bit as charming as its more touristy cousin Gion, with the bonus of fewer crowds and excellent photo opportunities.
