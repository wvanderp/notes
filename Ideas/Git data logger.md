## Application Specification Summary

## Overview

The purpose of this application is to simplify the process of logging personal data, such as daily observations and habits, directly into a GitHub-hosted Markdown file. The application will provide a mobile-friendly interface that dynamically loads questions, collects responses, and securely pushes updates to a GitHub repository. The focus is on ease of use, with a streamlined process that minimizes the steps required for the user to log their data.

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - The application will employ a two-part authentication system:
     - A backend-secured password for access to the web interface.
     - GitHub authentication handled by the backend, requiring the user to be authenticated with GitHub for any Git operations.

2. **Dynamic Question Management:**
   - The frontend will dynamically load questions from the backend, which are defined in JSON templates stored in the GitHub repository.
   - The application will support frequent updates to questions without requiring changes to the frontend code.
   - Conditional logic can be defined in the question templates, allowing questions to be shown or hidden based on previous answers.

3. **Data Submission and Processing:**
   - User responses will be submitted to the backend, where they will be processed and formatted using Handlebars templates.
   - The application will support different types of file operations, including creating new files, appending to existing files, or replacing specific content within files.

4. **GitHub Integration:**
   - The backend will securely handle all Git operations, including committing and pushing updates to a specified GitHub repository.
   - The application will manage conflicts by treating the GitHub repository as the authoritative source. In case of a conflict, the user will be prompted to re-answer the questions.
   - The application will only function with an active internet connection and will not store any data locally.

5. **Push Notifications:**
   - The application will implement push notifications to remind the user to log their data. Notifications will link directly to the app, enabling quick and efficient data entry.

6. **Metadata Logging:**
   - Metadata such as the time of submission, device used, and IP address will be made available to the Handlebars templates, allowing this information to be included in the Markdown files if desired.

7. **Cross-Platform Accessibility:**
   - The application will be accessible across various devices and platforms, ensuring that users can log data from any device with an internet connection.

### Nice-to-Have Features

- **In-App JSON Template Editing:**
  - While the initial prototype will require manual updates to JSON templates via the backend, future iterations may include the ability to edit these templates directly within the app.
  
- **Logging and Backup Mechanism:**
  - A simple server-side logging mechanism could be implemented to track submission attempts, successes, and errors, providing a basic level of backup and troubleshooting capabilities.

### Implementation Notes

The application will be developed as a JavaScript web app to ensure accessibility from any device. The backend will manage authentication, question templates, data processing, and Git operations, while the frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for data entry. Handlebars templates will be utilized for flexible and customizable data formatting. GitHub will serve as the central repository for both the question templates and the logged data, ensuring everything is version-controlled and easily manageable.

This setup focuses on simplicity, security, and ease of use, with potential for future enhancements as needed.
