# Encro obsidian

I wan encrypted obsidian notes that are handeld ly real obsidian notes but are stored encrypted.

So when you want to view or edit them they are decrypted on the fly.

Also search should work.

The key is stored and shared trought a other channel

The attack vector is files on a public GitHub. You computer is concidered to be save.
