## Abstract

This paper presents the development and implementation of the Tugboat Simulation System (TSS), a software designed to model the dynamic behavior of a tugboat towing a series of boats in a two-dimensional (2D) environment. The simulation captures both the physical interactions between the boats and the environmental factors such as water currents and wind, providing a realistic and computationally efficient representation of maritime towing operations.

The core of the TSS lies in its use of simplified water dynamics through a grid-based vector field, which abstracts complex fluid behaviors to maintain performance on standard computing hardware. The tugboat’s propulsion is simulated using a thrust force field, which impacts the movement of the boats behind it, creating a realistic representation of the towing process. The physical interactions between the boats are modeled using a spring-damper system, allowing for accurate simulation of the forces and constraints at play.

This paper outlines the step-by-step development of the TSS, from the initial setup of the simulation environment to the final implementation of advanced features such as user interaction and real-time environmental adjustments. The result is a versatile tool that can be used for educational purposes, research into maritime towing dynamics, or as a foundation for more complex simulations. The TSS provides a balance between realism and computational efficiency, making it an accessible and valuable resource for both academia and industry.
