Google Bard would summarize the story as follows:

The author was training to fly an SR-71, and he and his RIO Walt were flying their final training sortie. They were flying over Arizona and had just passed the 100-hour mark when they heard a Cessna pilot on the radio ask for his ground speed. The controller replied that he was doing 90 knots. A few minutes later, a Twin Beech pilot asked for his ground speed, and the controller replied that he was doing 125 knots. Then, a Navy F-18 pilot asked for his ground speed, and the controller replied that he was doing 620 knots. The author thought this was a ripe opportunity to show off his SR-71's speed, but he knew that he had to let Walt control the radios. Walt asked the controller for their ground speed, and the controller replied that they were doing 1,842 knots. The author was impressed with Walt's professionalism, and he knew that they were going to be a good team.
