## new monitor

I feel like I need to replace my monitor held up with wires and replace it with a ok but not great one.

although I can also get a monitor tat functions as a hub.

that would mean the following connections

**input**
2 inputs one connected to the pc and one to the laptop.
so at least 1x usbc + power delivery
and the ability to get usb and video to and from the pc

**io**
3 usb ports for mouse and keyboard and webcam
audio jag for sound.
probably and other usb or ethernet for internet.



**outputs**
1x DisplayPort out for one monitor.
1x HDMI out for small monitor. although we also can replace that one

**solutions?**
Dell U3423WE
Dell U4323QE
