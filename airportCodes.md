```plain
This is a number that contains a one-letter suffix.
The number is assigned to the airport in ascending order depending on the state and the associated city.
The number is stored in a computer for the purpose of producing computer reports of airports in alphabetical order by state and associated city.
The suffix indicates the primary use of the facility.  

For example: FAA SITE NR: 10430.A

A = Airport
B = Balloonport
C = Seaplane Base
G = Gliderport
H = Heliport
S = Stolport
U = Ultralight Flightpark
```

## our airports

[website](https://ourairports.com/)
[wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19801308)

our airports has three identifiers that are different from the ones listed above

### id

first they have the `id` witch is a numeric id for every airport in there database.
this will stay the same even as the codes change

### ident

then they have `ident` witch will be the ICAO if its avalibol. if the airport does not have a ICAO code then it will be a internaly generated code.
this code will be build from the country code and the incrementd four digit number seperated by a dash `-`.  
so the format is `xx-xxxx`. and the regex is `[A-Za-z]{2}-[0-9]{4}`

this same format is also used by [https://metar-taf.com](https://metar-taf.com/) altough they wrongly state that this is the icao code of the airport

### gps code

the last indentifier they have is the `gps_code` this is a random collection of all the above mentioned codes.
