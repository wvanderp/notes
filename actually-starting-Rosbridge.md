If you're new to the world of ROS (Robot Operating System), you might be wondering how to get started with rosbridge, which is a key component of ROS that enables communication between ROS and other software platforms. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps needed to get rosbridge up and running on your system.

To start, you'll need to have ROS installed on your system. If you haven't already done this, you can find instructions on how to do so at the official ROS website. Once you have ROS installed, you'll need to install the rosbridge package. This can be done using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-galactic-rosbridge-server
```

Once the installation is complete, you'll be ready to launch rosbridge. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```

This will start the rosbridge server, which will allow you to connect to it from other software platforms.

Once the ROS master is running, you should be able to connect to rosbridge from other software platforms and start using ROS in your applications.

In summary, to start rosbridge, you'll need to install the rosbridge package using the apt-get command and then launch the rosbridge server using the ros2 launch command. Make sure to also start the ROS master if it isn't already running, and you'll be ready to use rosbridge to connect to ROS from other software platforms.
