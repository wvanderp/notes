# The Choice I Made, Straight Up

*Adapted from Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken"*

Yo, I was at this crossroads, right?
Had me a real dilemma, couldn't do both in one night.
Stood there for a minute, pondering real deep,
Checkin' out one path, tryna take a good peep.

Decided on the other, felt it was kinda fly,
Figured it had a bit more charm, caught my eye.
Though truth be told, both were kinda worn,
Tread by many, almost equally worn.

Sun came up, both paths looked chill,
No footprints yet, they were untouched and still.
Kept the other option in my back pocket, a play,
But life's funny, paths lead their own way.

In the end, I'll reminisce and sigh,
In the future, wonder 'bout the paths gone by,
Two roads diverged, it was my call,
I took the bold one, and that's changed it all.
