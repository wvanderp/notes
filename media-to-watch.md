### Romeinse tragedies

This program is a modern adaptation of three plays by Shakespeare: Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra. it is performed in Dutch and is 6 hours long. I've seen some parts of it, which were very good.

I seems that the video has disappeared from the internet.
Its not on npo start and not on the pirate bay.
