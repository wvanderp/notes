# Journal entry for Friday, 2024-09-06

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had dinner but did not note specifics, assessed my day with no grade, arrived late to work, and didn't shower. My day included an unspecified morning, a missing afternoon log, and no details about post-work and evening activities. Reflecting on interactions, I noticed how morning events impacted my mood and awareness. I felt proud of certain moments but didn't specify the actions. I tried to strike a balance in self-care versus aiding others and chose to prioritize myself in some instances, enhancing my well-being compared to prior days. Worthwhile activities were compared, and bad habits were addressed with strategies from the previous day, planning new approaches for today. I concluded with a need for a more detailed plan and learning reflection for tomorrow.
