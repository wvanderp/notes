# Journal entry for 2024-06-27

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had macaroni for dinner and rated the day a 6. In the afternoon, I worked with a colleague on his React skills, bought a tent after work, and spent the evening packing for Defqon.1—a significant hardstyle music festival I'm excited about since it's my first time going again since 2017. I also caught up with Arjan, whom I last saw at Marwijn's service, and appreciated reconnecting. The day involved continuing to help clear my grandma's house alongside my brother, mother, and aunt, furthering our progress toward selling it by moving items from the attic to the second floor. I took proactive steps for my well-being by seeking help at a tent store and buying organizational items for my room. While I didn't complete all my goals, like visiting the third floor, I tried to pack for Defqon.1 earlier than usual. Tomorrow, I will focus on finishing work, buying the last few items for Defqon, and enjoying the festival.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned packing for Defqon.1 and that this is the first year you've been able to motivate yourself to go again since 2017. What were the challenges you faced in those intervening years that kept you from attending, and what has changed this year that made it possible for you to return?

The decision to go this year was an impulsive one. Other years were a combination of not getting tickets, coronavirus, and needing more energy to go.

Also, I noticed that ticket swap lets you put your name on the ticket. This reduced some of the uncertain of buying thickets through them.

2. You've long been fascinated with hardstyle music and noted Defqon.1 as a key place this genre is celebrated. Could you describe a memorable experience or highlight from your previous visits in 2016 and 2017? How do these memories influence your expectations for this year's festival?

It is one of the only places where you don't have to be ashamed to listen to the harder styles of music. In the real world, the music is often labeled as noise.

## Reflections

Reflecting on today with my goals in mind:

1. **Awareness of Feelings:**
   - Recalling today's events and interactions, how often did I pause to acknowledge my feelings? Did any particular moment stand out where I was truly in tune with my emotions?
   - Yesterday, I appreciated reconnecting with Arjan. Did I have any similar moments of emotional connection or self-awareness today?

I did not have any of these moments today.

2. **Proud of Myself:**
   - What achievements or positive moments am I proud of today? How do these compare to my proactive steps yesterday, like packing early for Defqon.1 and seeking help at the tent store?
   - Did I accomplish something that fills me with pride today, similar to my proactive efforts yesterday?

The road to defqon.1 was uncertain, but I managed to get there and have a great time.

- the address of the parking spot did not point to an exact location. So, it was unclear where I would be parking
- The bus broke down, so we had to wait for another on
- Arriving at Defqon, I needed to figure out what camping I could stand in.
   - so I just picked on and walked in.

4. **Worthwhile Endeavors:**
   - What did I do today that felt meaningful or fulfilling? How does it compare with significant actions from yesterday, such as helping clear my grandma's house?

I went to defqon.1 and had a great time.
