# Journal entry for 2024-06-27

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had a busy day rated at a 6, starting with an unspecified morning but spending the afternoon helping a colleague improve his React skills. After work, I bought a tent and spent the evening packing for Defqon.1, a significant hard-style music festival I've been eager to attend since my last visit in 2017. I caught up with Arjan, whom I last saw at Marwijn's service, and it was good to reconnect. Additionally, I helped my family clear out my grandma's house, moving items from the attic to the second floor, with plans to rent a trailer next week for disposal. I'm looking for new developer projects, enjoying both software and hardware roles. Emotionally, I remained neutral throughout the day but felt proud for seeking help at the tent store and focusing on getting organized by purchasing storage boxes. Although I didn't visit the third floor as planned, I managed to make some progress in packing for Defqon.1, which remains my main focus for the upcoming days.
