# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-07-22

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, you spent the day in a productive and familiar environment, engaging in a mix of leisure and work activities. You started the morning on time but spent some time watching Instagram reels. The afternoon was productive, with work on a crawler and enjoying the F1 race, while the evening included contributing to OpenStreetMap and watching CNN about Biden stepping down. You reflected on your calm demeanor despite stress and took pride in keeping everyone safe in a prior incident. No significant emotional shifts were noted today, but you did feel proud of building a complex web scraper. You didn't make any changes to your habits but recognized a need to work on this in the future. There were no moments of being egotistical as your day didn't demand it. Tomorrow's plans include returning to work, playing DnD in a new setting, and organizing appointments for psychological tests. You learned several new things, including Biden not running for re-election and the complexities of building good software.

## Questions about yesterday
