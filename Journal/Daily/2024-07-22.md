# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-07-22

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, you spent the day in a productive and familiar environment, engaging in leisure and work activities. You started the morning on time but spent some time watching Instagram reels. The afternoon was productive, with work on a crawler and enjoying the F1 race, while the evening included contributing to OpenStreetMap and watching CNN about Biden stepping down. You reflected on your calm demeanor despite the stress and took pride in keeping everyone safe in a prior incident. No significant emotional shifts were noted today, but you did feel proud of building a complex web scraper. You didn't change your habits but recognized a need to work on this in the future. There were no moments of being egotistical as your day didn't demand it. Tomorrow's plans include
returning to work,
playing DnD in a new setting, and
organizing appointments for psychological tests.
You learned several new things, including Biden not running for re-election and the complexities of building good software.

## Questions about yesterday

> You mentioned that reverting to pre-camp habits was something you observed but did not address any changes to improve them. What pre-camp habits do you consider bad or unproductive, and what concrete steps can you take tomorrow to start changing them?

I think that I was mainly talking about watching short-form videos and pushing myself too hard.

No, I don't think so because because work is chaotic at the moment.

> You mentioned a few key learnings today, including that building good software is hard and the news about Biden. How do you plan to apply this learning about building good software to your future projects, and are there any specific aspects of today's activities that highlighted this challenge for you?

I found a lot of little mistakes in my crawler that showed me that programming in the unknown is difficult.
