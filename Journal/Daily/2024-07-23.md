# Journal entry for Tuesday, 2024-07-23

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had Chinese for dinner and rated the day a 6. I was barely on time for work at 9:30. In the morning, I filled out numerous questionnaires for my psychologist, then completed the first task of a new project in the afternoon. After work, I drove to Gouda to play D&D, which I continued into the evening. Throughout the day, I didnâ€™t experience any strong emotions but felt accomplished noticing that many decisions I made for a website were correct. No opportunities arose for me to be assertively advocating for myself.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned that you "filled out a lot of questionnaires for the psychologist" in the morning. Can you describe the types of questions you had to answer and how filling them out made you feel or think about your current situation?

2. You graded your day as a 6 and mentioned being almost late to work ("yes barely at 0930"). Can you provide more details on why you rated your day a 6 and what influenced this grade? Also, what factors contributed to you nearly being late to work?

3. You drove to Gouda and played Dungeons & Dragons after work. How did the game session go, and what role do such activities play in your life? Do you feel they impact your overall well-being or daily mood?
