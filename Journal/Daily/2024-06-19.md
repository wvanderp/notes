# Journal entry for 2024-06-19

**What did you have for dinner?**: 
**Grade for the day**: 

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I felt tired and unfulfilled due to late nights and ongoing work frustrations, primarily caused by persistent bugs, a failed photogrammetry project, and a lack of significant achievements. Despite this, I identified and fixed several bugs and managed to communicate my desire to attend a festival with fellow scout leaders, who agreed to cover for me. I noticed the importance of thorough testing, recognized that taking breaks from commitments could be beneficial, and observed the inflated prices of scalpers. Moving forward, I plan to complete my work ticket, refine my journal system with automatic templates, and ensure I take quality photos for the photogrammetry project.

**Action Items for Tomorrow:**
1. Finish the work ticket.
2. Refine the journal system with automatic templates.
3. Take quality photos for the photogrammetry project.

## The questions

1. How did I feel overall today? (Provide 3-5 adjectives)

2. What activities or moments made me feel proud of myself today?

3. Did I take time for myself and prioritize my needs, or did I find myself selflessly giving to others? Give an example.

4. Reflecting on yesterday's action items:
   - Did I finish the work ticket? How did that make me feel?
   - Did I make any progress in refining the journal system? Describe it.
   - Did I take quality photos for the photogrammetry project? How do I feel about them?

5. What was something worthwhile I did today, no matter how small?

6. What challenged me today, and how did I overcome or address it?

7. How can I better embrace taking time for myself tomorrow?

8. What one thing would I like to achieve tomorrow that will make me feel accomplished and proud?

9. What new thing did I learn or realize today about myself or my environment?

10. End with a positive affirmation or a gratitude statement for something or someone in my life.
