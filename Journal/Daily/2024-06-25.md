# Journal entry for 2024-06-25

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I spent the morning working on OpenStreetMap (OSM) due to a lack of work tasks, and in the afternoon, I coached a colleague on React, which felt rewarding. After work, I tested cameras for photogrammetry and continued research in the evening. I felt guilty about doing personal tasks during work hours but appreciated the impact of my OSM contributions. Achievements included helping a colleague, which boosted my satisfaction, and recognizing hints from another coworker. Although I lacked a balance between personal and others' needs, aiding my colleague was fulfilling. Plans for today include:
- Speaking with my Business Manager (BM).
- Clearing out my grandmother's house.
- Deciding on a tent for Defqon 1.
My dinner was spinach penne, and I rated the day a 5/10.

## What happened today?

### What did you do today?

**Morning**: overslept and set a challenge for my colleagues

## The questions

1. Reflecting on Today's Emotions:
   - What were the most prominent feelings you experienced today? Can you pinpoint when and why they occurred?

I did not have any big emotions today.

I felt excited for defqon.1.

I was glad to talk to Arjan about how he and Vector are doing.

2. Acknowledging Your Achievements: 
   - What is one thing you did today that made you feel proud? How did that accomplishment make you feel about yourself?

I could just whip up some HTML and CSS to replicate a design. It needs some polishing, but I'm going the right way.

Also, we moved all the stuff from the attic to the second floor in a short time.

3. Balancing Self and Others:
   - Did you balance giving to others and taking time for yourself today? Provide an example of how you achieved (or struggled with) this balance.

There was little me time today. Although, I did take some time during the work day.

4. Doing Something Worthwhile:
   - What activity or task did you engage in today that you consider worthwhile? Why was it meaningful to you?

We are slowly clearing out Grandma's house so we can sell it.
And then we are done with it.

5. Addressing Guilt and Self-Appreciation:
   - Reflecting on any feelings of guilt or self-criticism today, is there something you could do differently to turn those feelings into positive actions or self-appreciation tomorrow?

I need to be proactive to get a new project. I can't just wait for them to figure it out.

## Plans for Tomorrow

Show my face on the third floor.

Find and buy a tent
