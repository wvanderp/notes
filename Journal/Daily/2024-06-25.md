# Journal entry for 2024-06-25

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I spent the morning working on OpenStreetMap (OSM) due to a lack of work tasks, and in the afternoon, I coached a colleague on React, which felt rewarding. After work, I tested cameras for photogrammetry and continued research in the evening. I felt guilty about doing personal tasks during work hours but appreciated the impact of my OSM contributions. Achievements included helping a colleague, which boosted my satisfaction, and recognizing hints from another coworker. Although I lacked a balance between personal and others' needs, aiding my colleague was fulfilling. Plans for today include speaking with my Business Manager (BM), clearing out my grandmother's house, and deciding on a tent for Defqon 1. My dinner was spinach penne, and I rated the day a 5/10.
