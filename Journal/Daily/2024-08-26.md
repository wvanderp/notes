# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-08-26

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I started the day by sleeping in, spent the afternoon playing Horizon Forbidden West and working on my story, and in the evening, I made a rough plan for my Japan trip. Dinner was something Matthijs made. I learned about the Suzuka circuit and reflected on my struggles with maintaining habits. For tomorrow, I plan to work on IBIS, remove the sutures from my knee, continue developing a markdown parser, and figure out a system for tracking my mood. I gave the day a grade of 7 and decided to shower the following morning.
