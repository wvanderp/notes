# Journal entry for 2024-06-24

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had Knaks on bread for dinner since Matthijs prepared a dish with too many greens. I rated the day a 6 out of 10. In the morning, I worked on programming for CartoCam, and in the afternoon, I focused on tasks related to OSM. By the evening, I spent time cleaning. Throughout the day, I was physically exhausted from staying awake for over 30 hours for the 12-hour race, which was the most intense emotion I experienced. A sense of pride came from seeing that my site, CartoCams, had tens of users, motivating me to improve it further. I did not prioritize anyone else's needs over mine, and by the evening, I did some things that were expected of me. There were no notable emotional engagements with others, similar to my experience at Marwijn's funeral service.

## What happened today?

**What did you have for dinner**: Spinazi penne
**Grade for the day**: 5
### What did you do today?

**Morning**: I did some OSM because I do not have a project at work
**Afternoon**: Coached a colleague on React
**After work**: Did some test for what camera is best for photogrammetry
**Evening**: worked some more on the research
## The questions

1. **How did I feel throughout the day?**
   - Reflect on positive and negative emotions, and consider what specifically triggered these feelings. Think about moments that made you feel proud, exhausted, happy, or indifferent.

I felt guilty because I was doing personal stuff on company time.
But they are responsible for my having something to do.

It felt good to explain things to the colleague.

2. **What three things I accomplished today made me feel proud or satisfied?**
   - These can be big or small achievements, including any work done for CartoCams, personal tasks completed, or moments where you focused on your needs.

Besides that, the work I'm doing for OSM is significant and can potentially benefit countless people, which is a source of pride and motivation for me.

I do feel that I did nothing worthwhile today.

I feel proud that I caught some hints that one of my other colleagues was dropping.
And that I assist the college, whom I am helping, correctly. (or at least similar to the other people around)

3. **How did I balance my needs and those of others today?**
   - Reflect on situations where you prioritized your needs over others and moments when you helped someone else. Consider whether this balance felt right for you.

There was no balancing to be done.

However, by helping the college, I demonstrated my knowledge to those around me, which set me up for a new project.


4. **Did I engage in any actions today that I consider worthwhile or fulfilling? Why or why not?**
   - Think about activities or tasks that contributed to your fulfillment, whether related to work, personal projects, or other endeavors. If there were none, consider what barriers might have prevented this.

Helping the colleague is fulfilling.

## Plans for Tomorrow

I need to talk to my BM to plan the next steps.

I need to clear out my grandmother's house in the evening.
