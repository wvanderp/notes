# Journal entry for Thursday, 2024-08-15

## Summary of yesterday's entry

I had a homemade pasta dish for dinner and gave the day a grade of B+. I managed to arrive at work on time. In the morning, I finished a project report, and in the afternoon, I attended a productive team meeting. After work, I went for a jog, and in the evening, I relaxed with a book. Emotionally, I felt most engaged during the team meeting, which felt more impactful than yesterday’s community event. I was proud of my contribution to the project report, which gave me a sense of accomplishment surpassing the confidence from yesterday's client presentation. For self-care, my evening reading time felt more restorative than the previous day's activities. Today's most worthwhile activity was the successful project report completion, which felt more growth-oriented than yesterday's networking. I noticed I was easily distracted by my phone but managed it better by using a focus app, which worked slightly less effectively than yesterday's structured breaks. Plans for tomorrow include continuing work on a new project and focusing on minimizing distractions.
