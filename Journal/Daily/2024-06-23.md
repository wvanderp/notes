# Journal entry for 2024-06-24

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Over the last two days, I attended Marwijn's funeral service, where I struggled to emotionally connect with former colleagues, though I shed some tears during the service. I participated in the 12-hour race (12 uurs race), which I had meticulously prepared for, including doing the groceries and ensuring the children were adequately tired. Despite minimal food variety (knaks on bread), I felt proud of my involvement and management of the event logistics. My emotional journey included moments of detachment and fulfillment, highlighting a balance of selflessness and self-interest as I left the service early to avoid conversations. These experiences underscored my role's importance and contribution to the event's success.

I was mainly physically tired from staying awake for 30+ hours for the 12 uurs race.

I noticed that my site CartoCams had 10s of users. This made me feel proud of what I had done.
It made me want to work on the site more and that is what I did.


3. **Healthy Self-Interest:** Consider an instance today where you prioritized your needs over others. Describe the situation and your decision-making process. How did this impact your feelings of self-worth?

I did not do anything that I did not want to do. At night, I did some things that were expected of me
