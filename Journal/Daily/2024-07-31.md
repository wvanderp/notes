# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-07-31

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday was a low-productivity day, marked by a sense of laziness and self-care. I had burritos for dinner and graded the day a 5. Being punctual, I worked from home but skipped a shower. The day was filled with casual activities: checking emails, watching the Olympics, gaming with friends, and handling some admin work in the evening. Emotionally, it was a recharge day without significant highs or accomplishments, unlike the previous day where I had meaningful achievements. I struggled with limiting my consumption of short-form videos despite setting Instagram limits, and I recognized the need for stronger measures. Plans for tomorrow include a therapist visit, buying a present for Daniel, and going to work.
