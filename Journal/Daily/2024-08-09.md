# Journal entry for Friday, 2024-08-09

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had pasta with marinara sauce, and I would grade the day as a B+. I was on time for work and did take a shower. In the morning, I attended a productive meeting; in the afternoon, I focused on a challenging project; after work, I went for a jog; and in the evening, I relaxed and watched a movie. Throughout the day, I felt mostly content and motivated, with a few moments of stress during the project, which I managed well. I made myself proud by completing the project on time and helping a colleague with their tasks. I balanced self-care by jogging and relaxing in the evening, which felt rejuvenating. A worthwhile activity was helping my colleague, as it reinforced teamwork and camaraderie. A bad habit was procrastinating on some minor tasks, and I plan to work on better time management. Today, I learned new techniques for project management. Thoughts are swirling about upcoming deadlines. Plans for tomorrow include following up on todayâ€™s project, another jog, and calling a friend.

## Questions about yesterday

1. It seems you didn't fill out the specifics for your morning, afternoon, and evening in the "What did you do today?" section. Could you provide more details about your activities during these periods and how they made you feel?

2. Reflecting on your grade for the day and whether you were on time for work, can you elaborate on what these aspects of your day signify for you? Did anything particularly improve or hinder your overall evaluation and punctuality?

3. You left the "What did you learn today?" section blank. Could you take a moment to reflect on any lessons, big or small, that you might have learned? Consider interactions, work experiences, or personal insights.

2. In what ways did I make myself proud today? How did these actions align with my goal of being proud of myself?

3. Reflect on an instance today where I practiced being more egotistical (in a good way). Did I ensure my needs were met without always selflessly giving to others? How did that make me feel?

4. What did I do today that I consider worthwhile? How did this activity contribute to my personal growth or the well-being of those around me?
