# Journal entry for 2024-06-26

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I rated my day as a 6 and had friet, topstick, and mexicano for dinner from the pollepel. My morning involved oversleeping and setting a challenge for colleagues, while the afternoon was spent trying to match a colleague's work. After work, I helped clear out my grandma's house. Emotionally, I felt mostly neutral but was excited about Defqon.1 and glad to catch up with Arjan. I'm proud of quickly putting together some HTML and CSS and efficiently moving items from the attic to the second floor. I struggled to find personal time but managed a little during work. Clearing my grandma's house was a meaningful task as it moves us closer to selling it. I recognized the need to be proactive in securing a new project to avoid self-criticism. My plans for tomorrow include visiting the third floor, buying a tent, packing for Defqon.1, and assessing a colleague.
