# Journal entry for 2024-06-26

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I rated my day a six and had friet, topstick, and mexicano for dinner from the pollepel. My morning involved oversleeping and setting a challenge for colleagues, while the afternoon was spent trying to match a colleague's work. After work, I helped clear out my grandma's house. Emotionally, I felt primarily neutral but was excited about Defqon.1 and glad to catch up with Arjan. I'm proud of quickly assembling some HTML and CSS and efficiently moving items from the attic to the second floor. I struggled to find personal time but managed a little during work. Clearing my grandma's house was meaningful as it moved us closer to selling it. I recognized the need to be proactive in securing a new project to avoid self-criticism. My plans for tomorrow include visiting the third floor, buying a tent, packing for Defqon.1, and assessing a colleague.

## The questions

> You mentioned feeling excited about Defqon.1. Could you elaborate on what Defqon.1 is and why it's significant to you

I've listened to hardstyle music since high school. And Defqon is the place where this is celebrated most. I went in 2016 and 2017 but did not find the time afterward.
This is the first year I could motivate myself to go again.

> what is the context around catching up with Arjanâ€”how did that interaction go, and how long has it been since you last saw them?
The last time I saw Arjan was during Marwijns service. Unfortunately, we didn't have the chance to catch up on the project we both worked on. So, hearing some news from him was a pleasant surprise and I'm looking forward to reconnecting more.

So I am glad to hear some news on that front.

> It sounds like you had a busy day helping to clear out your grandma's house. Can you provide more details about this task? What exactly did you do, who else was involved, and how far along are you in the process of preparing the house for sale?
My brother, mother, and aunt joined me in the task of clearing out my grandma's house. We managed to empty the attic, but the items were only moved to the second floor. Our next step is to rent a trailer next week to dispose of the items we don't need.
When the house is cleared, we will begin selling it.

> You mentioned the need to be proactive in securing a new project to avoid self-criticism. What kinds of projects are you looking for?
I'm open to any project as long as it's in a developer role. I liked doing software because you don't need to move as much. But I also love hardware because of the physicality of it. So eighter is fine.

1. Reflecting on how you felt throughout the day, were there any moments where your emotions surprised you? How did your emotional state compare to the previous day's mostly neutral feeling with moments of excitement and gladness?

I was mostly neutral today.

2. What are three things you did today that you can be proud of? Did you naturally find these moments, or did you consciously strive to notice them, just as you did with the HTML and CSS achievements and attic move yesterday?

I'm proud that I was brave enough to ask people at the tent store to help me. Typically, I leave without what I need, so I have made some progress.

3. In what ways did you focus on yourself and your needs today, as opposed to selflessly giving to others? How did this balance compare to helping clear your grandma's house yesterday?

I bought some stuff and some other stuff for self-care in the future. My room is currently a mess, and the new boxes I purchased from Ikea will help me clear the mess.

4. Describe one worthwhile activity you engaged in today. Did it provide a sense of meaning similar to how clearing your grandma's house brought you closer to selling it? How did it make you feel? 

I bought some stuff

5. Reflecting on today's goals and tasks, such as visiting the third floor or packing for Defqon.1, were you proactive in achieving them? Did you face challenges like finding a new project yesterday to avoid self-criticism, and how did you address them?

I did not go to the third flow in contrast to my needs.

I'm still late in packing for Defqon.1, but Im earlier than usual.

## Plans for Tomorrow

Finish work.

Buy the last stuff for Defqon.

Enjoy Defqon.

Please make all questions about Defqon.1. I want to expand on that more.
