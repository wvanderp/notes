# Journal entry for Sunday, 2024-07-07

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had patat for dinner and rated the day an 8. The morning was spent sleeping in and watching TikToks, followed by cleaning the front of the house in the afternoon, and then the back in the evening, alongside watching the quarter-finals of the EK. Emotionally, I felt a new type of tiredness, energetic physically but mentally sluggish. I felt accomplished for cleaning the house, which was much needed. Despite not having time for personal projects, the break and physical activities were refreshing.

## Questions about yesterday

1. Can you elaborate on the type of tiredness you felt, particularly any specific thoughts or distractions that caused your head to not be "in the game"? How did this feeling affect your activities throughout the day?

2. You mentioned cleaning both the front and back of the house. Can you describe in more detail what this entailed and how you felt before, during, and after doing these tasks? 

3. You mentioned a lack of time to work on your own projects. Could you discuss what these personal projects are and why they are important to you? How did taking a break and engaging in physical activities impact your sense of balance between personal needs and responsibilities?
