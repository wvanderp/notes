# Journal entry for 2024-06-18

**What did you have for dinner?**: Food from food trucks at the company party (pulled chicken, sloppy joes)
**Grade for the day**: 4

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I felt tired and unfulfilled due to staying up late and an accumulation of work-related frustrations. My unfulfilled feelings stemmed from three main issues:

- Persistent bugs preventing me from completing my tasks
- A failed photogrammetry project due to using video instead of quality photos
- Lack of significant achievements throughout the day

However, I took pride in the number of bugs I identified and fixed. A notable challenge was communicating my desire to attend a festival to my fellow scout leaders, who agreed they could manage in my absence. I realized the importance of thorough testing. I can take breaks from commitments, and I have observed the inflated prices of scalpers.
I look forward to completing my ticket and refining my journal system with automatic templates tomorrow.

**Action Items for Tomorrow:**

1. Finish the work ticket.
2. Refine the journal system with automatic templates.
3. Take quality photos for the photogrammetry project.

## The questions

### Reflection on Today

1. **Feelings Awareness:**
   - How did I feel today? Were there moments of feeling particularly good or bad?
   - Were there any specific triggers that influenced these feelings?
I felt terrible today. I felt useless because I could not find the motivation to work. Or, more accurately, I found another thing more interesting.

After completing the task, I felt nothing, no joy or pride, which is a bit concerning.

2. **Pride in Accomplishments:**
   - What am I proud of accomplishing today? What small or big victories can I celebrate?
   - Did I fix bugs, complete tasks, or face challenges head-on?

I continued building this journaling system. which I put tougher in the morning.
I used years of skills to pull this off.
I can be proud that I can make something I want.

3. **Balancing Selflessness and Self-Interest:**
   - Did I make decisions today, prioritizing my needs without guilt?
   - Was there a moment where I felt I was successfully balancing self-care and self-giving?
   - How did I communicate my wants or needs to others today?

I did most of the communication in the evening, but there was no give-and-take.

I did take something in creating the journal system in the morning during company time.

4. **Meaningful Activities:**
   - What did I do today that felt worthwhile or fulfilling?
   - Did I progress on my work ticket, journal system, or photogrammetry project?

I built the journal system, for which I will get a few days of enjoyment.
Which is another problem: how do I make this a habit instead of an action

The work ticket is also ready for review.
The photogrammetry project is not worth further pursuing.

The preparations for the `12 uurs race` continue, with me providing more information about the race and the split of which children go in what boat.

5. **Lessons Learned:**
   - What did I learn today, either from successes or challenges?
   - Is there something that didn't go as planned, and what can I take away from that experience?

One of the key takeaways from today was learning how to use the open API, a skill that I found to be quite straightforward. I'm excited to apply this newfound knowledge to future projects, which I believe will significantly enhance my productivity and efficiency.

At the company party, I learned more about traffic lights than I ever wanted to know.

**6. Looking Ahead:**

- How can I better manage my time and energy tomorrow?
- What tasks or goals do I want to prioritize?
- Are there any potential challenges I foresee, and how can I prepare for them?
- What can I do tomorrow to have moments of joy or relaxation?

Tomorrow should not be about coding. I have a design task ahead of me, which is the most important thing.

I do, however, have to post the PR for my previous task, but I can give it to my senior because he is paid to review my code.

And then I have a presentation about design systems to attend in the evening so there is little time to relax.

I should consider what I want to do next as a big project.

One of the things on the horizon is summer camp, where I must arrange for quiduage.

## note for tomorrow

Add a question about how I like the new system, collecting feedback on what to change.
