# Journal entry for 2024-06-18

**What did you have for dinner?**: 
**Grade for the day**: 

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I felt tired and unfulfilled due to staying up late and an accumulation of work-related frustrations. My unfulfilled feeling stemmed from three main issues: persistent bugs preventing me from completing my tasks, a failed photogrammetry project due to using video instead of quality photos, and lack of significant achievements throughout the day. However, I took pride in the number of bugs I identified and fixed. A notable challenge was communicating my desire to attend a festival to my fellow scout leader, who agreed to manage in my absence. I realized the importance of thorough testing, my ability to take breaks from commitments, and observed the inflated prices by scalpers. I am looking forward to completing my ticket and refining my journal system with automatic templates tomorrow.

**Action Items for Tomorrow:**
1. Finish the work ticket.
2. Refine the journal system with automatic templates.
3. Take quality photos for the photogrammetry project.
