# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-07-29

## Summary of yesterday's entry

I had pasta for dinner and would grade the day as a 7 out of 10. I was on time for work and did shower. In the morning, I attended a meeting, and in the afternoon, I worked on a project. After work, I went for a jog and spent the evening reading. Reflecting on my day, I noticed I felt more relaxed after my jog compared to yesterday. Making the decision to focus more on my work accomplishments made me feel proud, similar to the sense of pride I felt after my jog the previous day. I balanced my personal needs and helping others well, prioritizing myself a bit more than usual. The most worthwhile activity was my project work, which gave me a similar sense of accomplishment as yesterday's jog. For tomorrow, I could increase my focus on personal well-being, perhaps by setting aside extra time for relaxation.
