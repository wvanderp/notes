# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-07-29

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Last week, from July 22nd through July 29th, was a blend of returning from camp, work challenges, social activities, self-care, and personal obligations. You kicked off the week feeling fatigued from camp and tackled some psychological evaluations, which affirmed your autism diagnosis. While certain days slipped under the radar (like July 23rd), you found joy in successfully introducing a new game mode to your friends on the 24th. The first meeting with your psychologist on the 25th was draining. However, it felt like a positive step forward, despite some stressful moments retrieving your laptop and emotionally taxing tasks like cleaning your late grandmother's house. Work remained demanding, highlighted by a detailed project presentation on the 26th. Over the weekend, you balanced obligations (helping build a clubhouse) with attempts at rest, and your Sunday saw a mix of productive work and much-needed rest. You wrapped up the week by aiming to create stability in your work routine and planning for a quiet, potentially relaxing evening.

## Questions about yesterday

> Reflecting on your psychologist's appointment on July 25th, you mentioned feeling that you didn't have a bond yet due to the compliments you received. Can you elaborate on what specific qualities or interactions you believe will help create a stronger connection with your psychologist over time?

I mainly took issue with the compliments about how I'm autistic and, thus, I'm good with computers. That undermines all the time and effort I put into learning the required skills.
I mainly need to talk to him about that.

> The project presented to you on July 26th seems quite complex and detailed. Given its scope, how do you plan to approach and manage this project moving forward? Could you benefit from additional strategies or resources to help mitigate feeling overwhelmed?

I think it's best to jump in and start working on it. I believe that I can handle it.

## What happened today?

**What did you have for dinner**: McDonald's (I was there to do some admin work)
**Grade for the day**: 7
**Were you on time for work?**: Yes (0918)
**Did you shower?**: Yes, because I did not shower yesterday or Saturday

## What did you do today?

**Morning**: got a `sproetje` (a high-priority task) in the form of a user that could not log in
**Afternoon**: Found the root cause of the problem and escalated it to the right team
**After work**: went to McDonalds to do some admin work

## Reflections

1. **Reflecting on Feelings:**
   - How did I feel throughout the day today? Were there any moments when I felt particularly strong emotions?

It went up and down. I felt a bit of imposter syndrome because I had no idea where to start to solve the problem.
But that quickly went away. I noticed that my previously gained skills like SQL, c#, and azure stuff translated to this project.

2. **Pride in Achievements:**
   - What is one thing I did today that made me proud? How did this make me feel about my progress towards my goals?

I managed to solve the problem with little help, which is more impressive because it was my first day in the code base.

3. **Balancing Self and Others:**
   - In what ways did I prioritize my needs today? Did I find a good balance between helping others and focusing on myself?

I worked hard for the client today, so tomorrow, I will rest.

4. **Worthwhile Activities:**
   - What meaningful activity did I accomplish today? How did this contribute to my sense of purpose or well-being?

I was of service to the end-user of our software.


I also worked on re-digitizing my contacts, which will help me deepen my connections with my friends.

## What did you learn today?

- about Azure AD, active directory, and LDAP in general
- parsing formats with LLMs is difficult because they don't follow a pattern

## Plans for Tomorrow

- work from home
- work on contact.json, a standard for writing JSON contacts
