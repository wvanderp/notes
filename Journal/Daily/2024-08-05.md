# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-08-05

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had grilled chicken with vegetables, and I would grade the day an 8 out of 10. I was on time for work and did take a shower. In the morning, I tackled some emails and attended a team meeting. The afternoon was spent working on a key project, and after work, I went for a jog. In the evening, I relaxed with a good book. Today, I felt more attuned to my emotions, particularly during an unexpected stressful moment where I managed to stay calm. I am proud of completing the project successfully, a step up from yesterday's smaller task of sorting paperwork. Today I focused more on self-care by taking breaks and not overworking, which improved my productivity and well-being. The most worthwhile activity was the jog; it cleared my mind and boosted my mood. I identified my tendency to procrastinate as a habit needing change and managed to start working on tasks earlier in the day. Today, I learned the importance of balancing work with self-care. For tomorrow, I plan to continue this balance and perhaps start a new book.
