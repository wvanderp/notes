# Journal entry for Monday, 2024-08-05

## Summary of yesterday's entry

## Questions about yesterday

## What happened today?

**What did you have for dinner**: Kapsalon (from the donner company on central station)
**Grade for the day**: 7
**Were you on time for work?**: yes

## What did you do today?

**Morning**: worked on making the current project future prove
**Afternoon**: extended a feature already in the project
**Evening**: went to `Deadpool and Wolverine`

## Reflections

1. Reflecting on today, what moments did you feel most in tune with your emotions?
I took a walk through the city after the movie. Partly to process the film and partly because it had been a while since I had been in the city. I decided not to wear my headphones and that left me alone with my thoughts, which was nice

2. What are you proud of accomplishing today? Was it a step up from yesterday's key project, and why?
I implemented a medium-difficulty feature in one day. Which is better than expected because I did not know the codebase.

3. Did you find a balance between giving to others and taking time for yourself today? How did this balance impact your overall well-being compared to yesterday?
My work on the project is a mix of two aspects. On one hand, I'm responsible for maintenance, which involves adding and repairing features in the program. On the other hand, I have a deep love for improving the application, and keeping it up-to-date with the latest technology. This passion keeps me engaged and motivated.

I love doing the second part. The first part is also ok. 

I stood fast and told the people that I needed to do the second part in addition to the first part.

5. What was your most worthwhile activity today, and how did it benefit you? How does it compare to yesterday's jog?
I watched an awesome movie I wanted to do it for a while.

7. Identify any habits you noticed today that hindered or supported your goals. 
Only doing what you like is bad for the project's overall progress.

## The dump
*dump any thoughts here*

Somehow, Deadpool and Wolverine managed to add to the gigantic task of watching the MCU.

To watch this movie, you would need to watch the following.

- MCU films and movies
- xmen + the new xman + logan
- blade universe
- the prevoius two deadpools
- old and new Fantastic 4
- daredevil and Electra movies
- some comics

watching the new MCU movies is a daunting task, but Deadpool takes it to a new level
