# Journal entry for 2024-06-22

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had lasagna for dinner and would rate the day a solid B+. In the morning, I worked on a deadline-driven project, and spent the afternoon attending meetings. After work, I relaxed with some exercise and enjoyed a quiet evening reading a book. Emotionally, I felt a mix of stress and satisfaction, triggered by tight schedules but managed through deep breathing. I felt proud for successfully presenting in a crucial meeting. I balanced selflessness and self-interest by prioritizing a workout session, which boosted my self-worth. Compared to practicing new skills yesterday, today's meaningful activity was making progress on a challenging task, which enhanced my professional development. I felt moderately comfortable with the attention I received, appreciating the recognition, though there were brief moments of discomfort which highlighted areas for personal growth.
