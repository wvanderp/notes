# Journal entry for Friday, 2024-09-13

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had spaghetti with marinara sauce. I graded the day a B+. I was on time for work and did shower. In the morning, I completed some emails and prepared for a meeting. The afternoon was focused on a project milestone which went smoothly without significant obstacles. After work, I went for a run, and in the evening, I watched a documentary. A morning highlight was successfully finishing a presentation, while an afternoon achievement was making progress on a key project. After work, engaging in running was a great way to unwind, and an evening conversation with a friend was particularly memorable. Reflecting on the day, I became more aware of my feelings during a team discussion, which helped me better articulate my thoughts. I felt proud completing the presentation, and prioritizing a healthy run made me feel energized. The evening conversation was a valuable activity, contributing to my goal of maintaining strong relationships. I noticed brief procrastination during the day and plan to set clearer boundaries tomorrow. 

Plans for tomorrow include finalizing the project report and scheduling a team brainstorming session.
