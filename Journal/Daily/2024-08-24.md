# Journal entry for Saturday, 2024-08-24

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had pasta with a side salad. I would grade the day as a B+, and yes, I was on time for work. In the morning, I attended meetings and handled several administrative tasks. The afternoon was spent working on a key project, which I made significant progress on. After work, I went for a run, and in the evening, I relaxed with a book. Emotionally, I felt more balanced than yesterday with moments of pride, particularly in my project achievements. I acknowledged my accomplishments and balanced selflessness with self-care by setting boundaries without guilt. I engaged in worthwhile activities like project work and exercise, which made me feel productive. A bad habit that surfaced was procrastination, which I addressed by setting a timer to stay focused, a method that also worked yesterday. I learned better time management strategies today. Thoughts in the dump include a reminder to prioritize self-care. Plans for tomorrow include finishing the project and preparing for upcoming meetings.
