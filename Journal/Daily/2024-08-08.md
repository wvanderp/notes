# Journal entry for Thursday, 2024-08-08

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday began with a morning routine of standard work tasks, followed by an afternoon focused on my primary project, WANDA. After work, I devoted time to learning about therapy, balancing this with a session of gaming in the evening to unwind. Reflecting on my day, I felt satisfied with how I maintained a balance between productive work and personal downtime, noting that my punctuality contributed positively to my overall mood. I was particularly proud of my dedication to both my professional responsibilities and my interest in therapy, acknowledging this gave me a strong sense of self-worth. I found my work on WANDA especially fulfilling as it aligns closely with my long-term goals. However, I identified a need to minimize distractions and plan to set clearer boundaries to enhance my focus. For today, I aim to be more mindful of my emotions and ensure I carry forward this balanced approach, with a primary goal of advancing both my project and personal development equally.
