# Journal entry for Thursday, 2024-07-25

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had pasta, and I graded the day as a solid 8 out of 10. I was on time for work. In the morning, I attended a meeting where I advocated for myself, which felt empowering and aligned with my goal of being more emotionally aware. The afternoon was spent completing reports, which made me feel accomplished. After work, I balanced my time by helping a colleague and then attending a yoga class, feeling a good mix of giving and personal time. In the evening, I relaxed with a good book. The most worthwhile activity was the yoga class, as it provided a sense of relaxation and progress in my personal well-being, similar to finishing a project task yesterday. Small actions like voicing my opinions in meetings are setting the stage for more leadership and assertiveness tomorrow.
