# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-07-24

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had pasta for dinner and rated the day a 7 out of 10. Despite being late for work, I managed to complete my shower. My activities were as follows: in the morning, I worked on the new project, finishing its first task which left me feeling accomplished; the afternoon was spent in meetings; post-work, I ran errands; and the evening included some personal time. Reflecting on my accomplishments, I felt satisfied upon completing the first task of the new project. I successfully advocated for myself in a meeting by voicing my opinion on a critical issue. Throughout the day, I experienced pride, frustration, and relief—similar yet more intense than yesterday. The most worthwhile activity was completing the project task, which gave me a sense of progress. I struggled with my goal of egotistical growth and plan to be more assertive tomorrow by taking on a leadership role in an upcoming meeting.
