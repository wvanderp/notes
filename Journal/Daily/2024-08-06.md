# Journal entry for Tuesday, 2024-08-06

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had kapsalon for dinner from the donner company at Central Station and rated the day a 7. I was on time for work, spending my morning future-proofing our project and my afternoon extending a feature. I ended the day by watching "Deadpool and Wolverine" and took a reflective walk through the city afterward without headphones. Despite being unfamiliar with the codebase, I felt proud of implementing a medium-difficulty feature in one day. Balancing my responsibilities and passion projects at work kept me engaged and motivated. Watching the movie was fulfilling, though it highlighted the overwhelming task of keeping up with the MCU. Tomorrow, I have my first session with a psychologist and will revisit an old project.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned walking through the city after the movie to process the film and be alone with your thoughts. Can you elaborate on what particular aspects of the movie you found most thought-provoking and how the walk helped you process them?

Somehow, this silly movie made me a bit emotional. While Deadpool is very influential in his timeline, he does not feel like that, and I can relate to that.

I also just like waking through the city and taking in the sights and sounds

2. You accomplished implementing a medium-difficulty feature in a day despite unfamiliar with the codebase. Could you describe the feature in more detail and share any specific challenges you faced during the process? How did this compare to similar tasks you've handled in the past?

One of the challenges I faced was my unfamiliarity with the code base. 
I was looking for the controller for the search endpoint, but when I found it, there was no implementation.
it turns out that the implementation is provided by the projects that use the shared API,

but I did not know this, so I called for help, which is difficult for me. to ask a 5-second question. Because I was three klicks removed from the file where the implementation was

3. You have listed many movies and comics required to appreciate "Deadpool and Wolverine fully." How do you feel about this extensive requirement, and do you plan to revisit or watch any of those titles shortly?

I'm medium up to speed on the MCU. Only last year have I been slacking, so I have recognized most of it.

## Reflections

## What did you learn today?

- I learned about cognitive behavior therapy
- and the psychologist introduced some weird eyeball therapy

## The dump
*dump any thoughts here*

I need to do more active relexing, like taking a walk. But to get motivated, I could do OSM with it. But am I then mixing relaxing with my insatiable need for productivity?

I need to discover my core values (or life rules, values I hold dear), but I am still determining how i'm going to find those.
can you include this question in tomorrow's entry 

## Plans for Tomorrow

Have a meeting for WANDA about the UI

I need to take Monday next week off.
