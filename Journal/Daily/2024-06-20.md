# Journal entry for 2024-06-20

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday was a mixed day, starting with a significant stride in my project's visual design and the successful implementation of three-way connections, a task for which prior documentation proved invaluable. In the afternoon, I included my mother in a user test for the application, highlighting areas for improvement. I received saddening news about a former close colleague's passing, which left me feeling silent but deeply saddened. In the evening, I improved my gaming skills by asking friends for feedback and worked on my LLM story writer project, which contributed to my personal and professional growth. I had pancakes with bacon for dinner, and I rated the day a 7. Reflecting on the day, I noted that I didn't engage in selfish acts and acknowledged the need for better management of emotions and interpersonal empathy.
