# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-09-18

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had pasta for dinner, graded the day a B+, and was on time for work, but didn't shower. In the morning, I followed my usual routine but struggled to get out of bed. At work, my afternoon was busy with meetings which affected my mood but not my productivity. After work, I ran errands, and in the evening, I watched a movie to wind down. Reflecting on my emotions, I noticed more awareness of my feelings compared to the previous day, particularly during dinner where the setting felt comforting. I felt proud of managing my tasks efficiently and balanced personal needs with work demands effectively. I took steps to reduce social media use, finding it more effective than yesterday. Overall, the day left me with a sense of accomplishment and better strategies to tackle habits.
