# Journal entry for Tuesday, 2024-07-16

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday was a fulfilling day at camp; I woke the children, played the sorting hat in the morning, set up an animal-themed activity in the afternoon, and enjoyed playing "lijntjes tekenen" in the evening. Dinner was BBQ, and I rated the day an 8. I felt genuine joy and camaraderie throughout the day and was proud of my leadership skills, as the children listened to me and made me feel loved and respected. However, I noted a decline in communication, recognizing the need for either stronger leadership or improved communication. Tomorrow's plans include a visit to Middelburg and potentially a "doopen" activity.
