# Journal entry for Tuesday, 2024-07-16

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday was a fulfilling day at camp; I woke the children, played the sorting hat in the morning, set up an animal-themed activity in the afternoon, and enjoyed playing "lijntjes tekenen" in the evening. Dinner was BBQ, and I rated the day an 8. I felt genuine joy and camaraderie throughout the day and was proud of my leadership skills, as the children listened to me and made me feel loved and respected. However, I noted a decline in communication, recognizing the need for either stronger leadership or improved communication. Tomorrow's plans include a visit to Middelburg and potentially a "doopen" activity.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned feeling "genuine joy" when playing `lijntjes tekeken` and liking your role as the sorting hat. Can you describe these activities in more detail and explain what aspects of them brought you the most joy?

I liked acting as the sorting hat. maybe i like acting in general.

lijntjes trekken is a riddle game where you connect the dots in a specific way.
I liked to see the children think and loved when they finally got it. I also liked when they go frustrated or came to the wrong awnser

2. You briefly mentioned that you feel the communication is slowly breaking down at camp. Can you provide specific examples of these communication issues and how they have impacted the camp activities or the children’s experience?

it's difficult to talk about all the things that need to be talked about cuz I don't think that the children noticed anything about it

3. You noted that you didn’t prioritize your own needs today as you believe it should be on camp. Can you reflect on how balancing self-care and leadership could benefit both you and the children at camp?

well on the one hand I'm here for the children and I need to do everything in my power to be there for them. I also need time for myself to recharge and to keep my energy at the right level to to be there for them and to be not tired

## Reflections

1. Reflect on today's experiences at camp: How did you feel emotionally throughout the day? Were there specific moments that evoked strong feelings? How did those emotions compare to the previous day?

I joke a lot about my dead father but everytime I do I get emotional so I think that I should stop doing that.

I also saw my brother sad in the morning but I did not know what to do.
