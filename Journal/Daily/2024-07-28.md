# Journal entry for Sunday, 2024-07-28

## Summary of yesterday's entry

## What happened today?

Since I failed to journal anytime last week, I asked ChatGPT to walk through the previous week with me. This is what we came up with:

*You*
Please help me make a summary of my last week. It starts on July 22nd and ends today, July 29th. Ask me what I did on those days and ask follow-up questions on how it made me feel or, if something is unclear, a clarifying question.

*ChatGPT*
Sure! Let's start with July 22nd. What did you do on that day?

*You*
I don't fully remember because it's more than a week ago, but I came back tired from camp two or three days ago and went to work where I started on a difficult project and couldn't really keep my mind on it. What I do remember is that in the morning, I filled out a lot of forms for the psychologist, and what I noticed about those questions is that they were very poignant to some various mental diseases, and I had none of them. I answered all of them in negative except for autism, which does verify my already existing diagnosis.

*ChatGPT*
It sounds like July 22nd was a bit overwhelming for you, especially after coming back from camp tired. How did filling out those forms for the psychologist make you feel, especially since you noticed the questions were quite specific? Did it impact your ability to focus on your difficult project at work?

*You*
It is something that I had to be done, and I did it partially for work and partially for myself, because I get my psychologist through work.

*ChatGPT*
It sounds like a practical step for both your personal well-being and professional requirements. How did you feel about the questions confirming your existing diagnosis of autism? Did it bring any new insights or feelings for you?

*You*
I always thought I had only a few of the symptoms of autism, but I realized through this questionnaire that I exhibited more of them than I expected. So that's nice to confirm my already diagnosed autism.

*ChatGPT*
It's good to have that clarity and confirmation. Did this new understanding of your symptoms affect how you approached your project or your work in general after that day?

*You*
No.

*ChatGPT*
Alright, let's move on to the next few days. How was July 23rd for you?

*You*
July 23rd is a real black space for me. I actually don't know what I did that day.

*ChatGPT*
No worries, that happens sometimes. Let's move on to July 24th. Do you remember what you did that day?

*You*
During the workday I don't, but I believe that I introduced my friends to a new game mode of League of Legends in the evening, and we all quite enjoyed it and have played it many times since that day.

*ChatGPT*
That sounds like a lot of fun! How did introducing your friends to the new game mode make you feel, especially since you all enjoyed it and have continued playing it?

*You*
It was a bit nervous, because I don't know if they would have liked it, if my suggestion was okay. But in the end, when they said, oh yeah, sure, we're gonna play it, then it felt very gratifying, because it feels like I pushed my friends into something which we all enjoyed.

*ChatGPT*
That's great to hear! It's always rewarding when something you suggest turns out to be a hit with friends. Moving on, how was your day on July 25th?

*You*
On 25th was a very busy day. In the morning I had my first appointment with my psychologist and it went okay, although I do feel like we don't have a bond yet, mainly because of the kinds of compliments he gave me, which were real compliments, but I don't really like what he said, but I think that will go away when we get to know each other much better. It was an intake, so there were lots of questions about my current situation, about how I felt, and

*ChatGPT*
It sounds like a significant day with your first appointment. How did you feel after the appointment, considering it was an intake and you were getting to know your psychologist? Did anything else happen on the 25th that stood out to you?

*You*
I felt about my appointment that it was a bit draining, but I also felt like it was a step on the right way. In the afternoon, I went to work, but I was reminded that I left my laptop in my car, so I had to go back to my car, which I left at the metro station, which my boss was not amused at, because it was a bad metro station where laptops get stolen. And then in the evening, I went to my grandmother's house to clean out her house, since she died and we need to sell the house.

*ChatGPT*
That sounds like a really full and emotionally charged day. How did you cope with the stress of the psychologist appointment and the situation with your laptop? And how was it for you emotionally, cleaning out your grandmother's house?

*You*
There was really no stress because, well there was some stress, I dealt with the nervousness of going to the appointment by really preparing for it, by looking up the location and how to get there and on what floor they are, and

*ChatGPT*
That's a smart way to manage the stress. Preparing can really help reduce anxiety. How did you feel emotionally while cleaning out your grandmother's house? Was it a difficult experience for you?

*You*
No, it's mostly work.

*ChatGPT*
Got it. Sometimes, focusing on the task can help manage emotions. Moving on, how was July 26th for you?

*You*
I believe that's a Friday, right? There, on the previous day, I got connections with some colleagues who worked on my project previously, and they agreed to give me a presentation about how the project works. And it was mainly a lot of information, because it's a very detailed and deep project. So that was quite a draining day.

*ChatGPT*
That does sound draining, absorbing a lot of detailed information. How did you feel after the presentation? Did it help you understand the project better?

*You*
It's a double-edged sword. At one side, I understand the project more. And on the other side, I gained a deeper understanding, but also thus could ask more questions about the project and see the broader scope of the project, which is very large.

*ChatGPT*
It sounds like it was both enlightening and overwhelming. How did you manage to process all that new information? Did you do anything to unwind after such a demanding day?

*You*
No, not really. Should I?

*ChatGPT*
It's always good to unwind after a demanding day, but it depends on what works best for you. Sometimes, a bit of relaxation can help clear your mind. What about the weekend, July 27th and 28th? How did those days go for you?

*You*
On Saturday, I was trying to make it a lazy day to relax from the busy week I had and I partially managed by staying in bed until late, but I also had an open invitation to some building of our new clubhouse, which I felt obligated to also work on. So in the afternoon, I went to the clubhouse and shoveled a lot of sand everywhere. And in the evening, I had a headache because I worked in the sun all day, and I needed to relax a bit, and I watched a movie.

*ChatGPT*
Sounds like Saturday was a mix of rest and hard work. How did you feel about the progress on the clubhouse? And did the movie help you relax and recover from the day's activities?

*You*
I felt that it was important to work on the Clubhouse, I don't know if we made the right kind of progress, because the instructions were not that clear. But since I will be using the Clubhouse a lot, I felt obligated to work on it. The movie, it was okay. The movie was good, but maybe it was better for me to just sleep in that time.

*ChatGPT*
It sounds like you had a sense of duty towards the clubhouse, which is admirable. Sometimes, though, it's tough to balance obligations with personal rest. Did you manage to rest more on Sunday, July 28th?

*You*
Yes and no. It was a bit of a mixed day because I went to bed early. I also woke up early, which is 9 o'clock. And then I started working on some personal projects in the morning. And in the afternoon I cleaned the house, because that didn't happen since summer camp. And, uh...

*ChatGPT*
It seems like Sunday was a productive day. Working on personal projects and cleaning the house must have felt satisfying. How did you feel by the end of the day after getting those tasks done?

*You*
Uhm, well, it's not a full story, because in the afternoon I started watching the F1 race, but I couldn't finish it, because I was too tired and my eyes were slowly shutting, so I slept from 3 to 6.

*ChatGPT*
That makes sense, given how busy your week was. It's good that you listened to your body and took that rest. How did you feel after the nap? Did it help you recharge?

*You*
At first I felt a bit groggy, but then in the evening I felt still tired, but not so tired that I needed to go to sleep. In the evening, I played a game and then worked on some writing projects.

*ChatGPT*
It sounds like the nap gave you just enough energy to stay productive in the evening. How did you feel about the writing projects you worked on? Were you satisfied with your progress?

*You*
Yes, it's a bit of a difficult time in the project, but yes.

*ChatGPT*
It's great to hear you made progress, even during a challenging part of your project. How about today, July 29th? How has your day been so far?

*You*
Well, it's currently 9 o'clock in the morning, and I only woke up and got into the car where I'm currently talking to you. So, medium, I did some chores, I took a shower, and then got dressed to go to work, so, yeah.

*ChatGPT*
Sounds like a typical start to the day. Do you have any specific plans or goals for today at work or outside of work?

*You*
At work, I need to create some stability for myself, because currently I have 8 hours a week of work, which I can work on the difficult project, but I don't really have a clear day that I can work on the project, and it just grows all over. And I need to write back to a friend about some feedback about a question he got about Raspberry Pi. I need to write some things down. I discovered about a project last week, and in the evening I'm either going to watch a movie, or I'm going to some cafe to do a writing session.

*ChatGPT*
That sounds like a productive day ahead. Creating stability for your work schedule can definitely help manage the difficult project more effectively. How do you feel about balancing these tasks today?

*You*
Well, the most of them are either not overlapping or just small tasks, so I just take the day as it comes.

*ChatGPT*
That sounds like a good approach. Taking the day as it comes can help keep things manageable. It seems like you have a balanced plan. Good luck with your tasks today!

*You*
Thank you. Can you maybe generate a general summary of my week and extract some themes and ask some questions for me to reflect on?
