# Journal entry for Sunday, 2024-07-21

## Summary of yesterday's entry

During camp, there were several notable events. On July 13, our ship faced a critical situation when the engine stopped working while sailing on the Oosterschelde with many children on board. My fellow scouts and I used a motorboat to help restart the engine while emergency services towed the main ship to safety. This event left me shaken. On July 18, we learned we'd depart camp a day early due to impending bad weather, which triggered sadness and panic in me. I felt a mix of emotions, from missing out on camp activities and the community to feeling unprepared for the sudden change. Expressing these feelings and engaging in activities helped me cope. By July 21, I noticed how quickly I reverted to pre-camp habits and recognized the need to make positive changes.

## Questions about yesterday

> Reflecting on the incident on the Oosterschelde, you mentioned feeling a sense of abandoning the main ship despite it not being that serious. Can you elaborate more on your emotions and how you believe they might have impacted you since then?

I always say to the children that people are more important than things. But at that moment, I chose things over people.

I also feel like I chose my safety over the safety of the children.

If I started towing the main ship, I would be able to get it into the harbor or into the wind so that it would deal with the waves better.

> You've outlined several possible reasons for feeling sad or panicky about leaving camp early. Can you investigate which of those reasons resonates most with you and why? Additionally, how has the quick end to camp affected your overall experience and memories of the camp?

When I looked back at the photos of the day, I was sad that I would not be there.
So I think that was the main reason, together with the unknown and some trauma.

I think I did not lessen the enjoyment of the camp.

>You noted that you've quickly fallen back into bad habits after returning from camp. Could you describe some of these habits and why you consider them 'bad'? Moreover, what specific changes or strategies might help you maintain the positive behaviors you experienced at camp?

watching a lot of instant videos
not taking time for the little things
same food and drink as before camp

I should think about this more tomorrow.

## Reflections

1. Reflecting on Today's Emotions: Yesterday, you felt shaken, sad, and panicked due to challenging events at camp. How did you feel today? Were there any specific moments that triggered strong emotions, and how did you handle them?

Today, I'm calm because I am in a familiar environment, doing things I know.

3. Pride and Accomplishment: Considering your goal of being proud of yourself and reflecting on how you helped restart the engine and ensured children's safety yesterday, what actions or achievements made you feel proud today? How did you recognize and celebrate these accomplishments?

I always thought of myself as staying calm in stressful situations.
And that day, I was proven right.

I saw it coming and was prepared for the people around me, and I acted when it happened.

The ship's captain was in light panic because he could not leave his station to fix the motor. So he could do nothing, and he agreed when I proposed decoupling the towed ships.

6. Positive Changes and Awareness: Thinking about how you observed reverting to pre-camp habits, what steps did you take today to implement positive changes in your routine? How did being more aware of your feelings help guide these changes?

I did not make any changes to my habits. This is something I want to work on

I successfully build a complex scraper for a story website in 2 days.

8. In what ways did I practice being more egotistical in a positive manner today? Did I recognize moments where I put my needs first? How did this impact my overall well-being?

I did not need to be egotistical today.

9. What was the most worthwhile activity I engaged in today?

I continued some projects I abandoned some time ago.
