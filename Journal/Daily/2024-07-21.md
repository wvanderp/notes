# Journal entry for Sunday, 2024-07-21

## Summary of yesterday's entry

During camp, there were several notable events. On July 13, our ship faced a critical situation when the engine stopped working while sailing on the Oosterschelde with many children on board. My fellow scouts and I used a motorboat to help restart the engine, while emergency services towed the main ship to safety. This event left me shaken. On July 18, we learned we'd depart camp a day early due to impending bad weather, which triggered sadness and panic in me. I felt a mix of emotions, from missing out on camp activities and the community to feeling unprepared for the sudden change. Expressing these feelings and engaging in activities helped me cope. By July 21, I noticed how quickly I reverted to pre-camp habits and recognized the need to make positive changes.

## Questions about yesterday

> Reflecting on the incident on the Oosterschelde, you mentioned feeling a sense of abandoning the main ship despite it not being that serious. Can you elaborate more on your emotions during that moment and how you believe it might have impacted you since then?

I always say to the clildren that people are more important than things. but in that moment I chose things over people.

I also feld like i chose my own safety over the safety of the children.

I think that I started towing the main ship I would be able to get it into the harbor or at least into the wind so that it would deal with the waves better.

> You've outlined several possible reasons for feeling sad or panicky about leaving camp early. Can you go deeper into which of those reasons resonate most with you and why? Additionally, how has the quick end to camp affected your overall experience and memories of the camp?

when I looked back at the photos of the day I was sad to not be there.
so I think that was the main reason tougether with the unknown and some trauma

I think I did not lessen the enjoyabilty of the camp.

>You noted that you've quickly fallen back into bad habits after returning from camp. Could you describe what some of these habits are and why you consider them 'bad'? Moreover, what specific changes or strategies do you think might help you maintain positive behaviors you experienced at camp?
