# Journal entry for 2024-06-21

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had a chicken burger wrap for dinner and rated the day a 5. In the morning, I learned that the project I was working on would not continue, so I focused on creating its documentation. The afternoon was spent helping someone learn React, during which I learned new design patterns. After work, I continued developing my LLM storyteller using the newfound knowledge and spent the evening gaming. Emotionally, I felt sad about the project's end but was relieved by the clarity, and I discussed Marwijn's death with colleagues, affecting my emotional responses. I was proud of my ability to help someone at an advanced React level and learn quickly. I also focused on self-improvement through gaming. Although helping someone was a selfless act, it provided me with personal learning opportunities. Practicing new skills felt meaningful, and while I managed to show some emotions and empathy, I wasn't entirely comfortable with the attention it drew.
