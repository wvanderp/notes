# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-08-28

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had dinner featuring arugula, mozzarella, and an unusual pasta. Although technically late to work due to a psychologist appointment, I managed a productive day, rating it a 7. My morning was spent at the appointment, followed by an afternoon working on the "five rules of Wanda." Post-work, I tested new writing software before attending a scouting meeting and finally working on a markdown parser in the evening. I didn't take a shower but plan to do so today. No specific reflections or notable accomplishments stood out, and there's a need for a new closet plan and to buy a suit for tomorrow.

## Questions about yesterday

1. Can you describe the "weird pasta" you had for dinner in more detail? What made it stand out or seem unusual to you?

3. You mentioned working on "the five rules of Wanda" in the afternoon. Can you elaborate on what that project entails and what progress you made?

4. Considering the bad habits you want to define and eliminate, did any resurface today? If so, how did you handle them, and what strategies can you implement to counteract them more effectively?

5. Reflecting on your previous day's intention to buy a suit and plan a new closet, how did these goals progress today? What steps did you take that you're proud of, and what can you plan for tomorrow to further these personal goals?
