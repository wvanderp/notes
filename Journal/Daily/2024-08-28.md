# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-08-28

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had dinner featuring arugula, mozzarella, and an unusual pasta. Although technically late to work due to a psychologist appointment, I managed a productive day, rating it a 7. My morning was spent at the appointment, followed by an afternoon working on the "five rules of Wanda." Post-work, I tested new writing software before attending a scouting meeting and finally working on a markdown parser in the evening. I didn't take a shower but plan to do so today. No specific reflections or notable accomplishments stood out, and there's a need for a new closet plan and to buy a suit for tomorrow.

## Questions about yesterday

well it had an unusual shape. it was like a circle rolled with a spone into a shell

2. How did your psychologist appointment go? Were there any insights or discussions that particularly resonated with you?
well yes I wrote them down:
