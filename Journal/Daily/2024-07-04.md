# Journal entry for Thursday, 2024-07-04

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had patat for dinner and rated the day a 4. I woke up late in the morning and worked from home, which continued into the afternoon. After work, I watched a movie and spent the evening on YouTube. Reflecting on the day, I realized I felt unaccomplished despite being busy and recognized a need to work on my motivation. Plans for today include a meeting with my manager and clearing out more of my grandma's house.

## Questions about yesterday

> You mentioned working from home in both the morning and afternoon. Can you describe what specific tasks or projects you worked on and how effectively you felt you completed them?

I wanted to continue working on the dart gitjournal project. Or sort out my defqon photos.

but instead, I Progresiworked on OSM by doing some maproulette tasks

> In your reflections, you expressed dissatisfaction with your productivity and motivation. Can you elaborate on your specific goals for the day and which ones you felt you didn't achieve? Do you have any ideas on improving your motivation in the future?

My goal is to have one of the projects finished.

I think that there are at least three things that I need to consider.

1. If you spend all your energy during the weekend, you have no energy left during the week.
 - in this case, Defqon was both physically and mentally existing
2. Don't underestimate the size of a task.
  - the dart project is in a language that I don't even know. and I don't know enough about git
  - sorting out the photos is a huge task that will take several evenings
3. you can force yourself to do more when you can even do what you are doing.
