# Journal entry for Thursday, 2024-07-04

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had patat for dinner and rated the day a 4. In the morning, I woke up late and worked from home, which continued into the afternoon. After work, I watched a movie and later spent the evening on YouTube. Reflecting on the day, I realized I felt unaccomplished despite being busy and recognized a need to work on my motivation. Plans for today include a meeting with my manager and clearing out more of my grandma's house.
