# Journal entry for Saturday, 2024-07-06

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had a productive day, starting with a meeting introducing me to a new project, then tackling major code refactoring in the afternoon, and watching the movie "Shooter." Despite not making it to work on time, I rated the day a seven. Emotionally, I felt motivated and proud of my skills due to my solid grasp of the new project, although I skipped a social event to focus on the work I enjoyed. I learned about Azure DevOps, my latest project, and styled-components. I plan to sleep in tomorrow, read up on quidditch rules, wash windows, and check the Dart gitjournal project.

## Questions about yesterday

> You mentioned meeting with your team lead, who introduced you to a new project. Can you elaborate on the scope and objectives of the new project and how it aligns with your skills and career goals?

I can not reveal too much because this is an open forum.

But it's a web development job where we maintain a CRM app.
I love that I can show what I can do on this project instead of leaning on the job.

> Regarding your decision to stay behind and skip the boss's goodbye party, how did this impact your work and your relationships with your colleagues? Would missing such social events affect your future opportunities at work?

I don't know because I can't peer into people's heads
