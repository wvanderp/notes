# Journal entry for Saturday, 2024-07-06

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had a productive day starting with a meeting introducing me to a new project, then tackled major code refactoring in the afternoon, and spent the evening watching the movie "Shooter." I rated the day a 7, despite not making it to work on time. Emotionally, I felt motivated and proud of my skills due to my solid grasp of the new project, although I skipped a social event to focus on work I enjoyed. I learned about Azure DevOps, my new project, and styled components. For tomorrow, I plan to sleep in, read up on quidditch rules, wash windows, and maybe check the Dart gitjournal project.
