## What happened today?

I did not journal that much during camp, but there are a few things I want to write about

### Saturday 2024-07-13

Today, I was in some real danger. Our ship was sailing on the Oosterschelde when the motor ceased operating. We had many children on board.

We needed to detach the boats we were carrying to restart the engine. So I and two fellow scouts jumped on the attached motorboat and detached from the main ship.

We started setting up a course for some piers in the distance. And left the main ship behind.
I could not shake the sense that I was abandoning them and leaving them to die (although it was not that serious)

Onboard the main ship, they called the emergency services, who arrived very quickly to tow them.

And we also sailed back to the same harbor through crashing waves that could have pulled us under.

I went as well as possible, but the whole event may still shake me, although I don't know how this manifests.

Today, we heard that we would be leaving the camp one day earlier to avoid some bad weather.

I don't know what it was, but this made me really sad or panicky.

I narrowed it down to the following things.

- trauma from the first journey
- I am sad to be leaving camp
  - both missing a day of activities
  - the joy that the children bring
  - and the ease of life that camp brings
- a feeling like I'm abandoning my fellow scouts by leaving early and leaving them with the clean-up
- the realization that camp is over
- the sudden change and feeling unprepared for it
- all the things I had put off to the last day that I now did not have

I cried uncontrollably until I asked some people about the plan and started participating in an activity.

It's funny how quickly I fall back into (bad) habits.
I'm not even one day back from camp, and I'm already back to doing what I was doing before.

I should make mental notes to change some habits
