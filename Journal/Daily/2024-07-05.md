## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday was a moderately productive day, graded a 6. I had a lazy morning but had to rush to work for a sudden meeting, which turned out to be beneficial as I took a stand for a timely discussion with my manager, boosting my self-worth. I spent the afternoon working on my resume and getting acquainted with a potential new project. In the evening, I helped clear out my grandma's second floor, which felt rewarding. I was emotionally neutral throughout the day but proud of my contributions and taking a step towards being more assertive. For tomorrow, I plan to start on time and set specific goals, including tasks for both current and new projects, and personal interests.

## Questions about yesterday

1. Can you elaborate on any particular challenges or successes you faced while working on your resume and getting familiar with the new project code? What did you learn from it, and how might it influence your approach moving forward?

2. You mentioned driving to your grandma's house after work and then helping to bring wood and other stuff to the dump. Can you describe the significance of this activity and how it impacted your evening emotionally or mentally?

3. Reflecting on your goal to be more egotistical in a positive way, how did the interaction with your manager and the successful rescheduling of the meeting at 11 affect your perception of your professional relationships and your approach to voicing your needs?
