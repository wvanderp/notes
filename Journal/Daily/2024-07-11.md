# Journal entry for Thursday, 2024-07-11

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had chicken stir-fry for dinner, rated the day a 7 out of 10, and was on time for work. In the morning, I completed a project report, and in the afternoon, I had a productive meeting with the marketing team. After work, I went for a jog and spent the evening reading. Emotionally, I felt stable with no significant highs or lows and handled them better than yesterday. I am proud of meeting my project deadline, which boosted my confidence. I balanced my needs by taking a break mid-day, and this helped maintain my productivity compared to previous efforts. The most fulfilling moment was the productive meeting, which aligned with my career goals. I took steps towards control by organizing my tasks and calling the psychologist, which alleviated some feelings of overwhelm. Tomorrow, I plan to prioritize finishing the market analysis report and attending my counseling session.
