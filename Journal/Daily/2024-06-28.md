# Journal entry for Friday 2024-06-28

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I rated the day a 7 and had Turkse pizza for dinner. My morning was spent at work, followed by last-minute shopping and driving to Defqon.1 in the afternoon. In the evening, I enjoyed hakkûh at Defqon.1. Reflecting on my goals, I noted a lack of emotional awareness and meaningful connections compared to the previous day's reconnection with Arjan. Despite challenges like an unclear parking location, a bus breakdown, and navigating the camping area, I successfully managed to arrive and have a great time at the festival. My plans for tomorrow include more hakkûh at Defqon.1.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned dealing with uncertainties on your journey to Defqon.1, such as parking issues, the bus breaking down, and figuring out the camping arrangement. How did you manage these challenges, and what did you learn from these experiences?

I could not have prepared any better because there was no more infromation to read. I just had to go with the flow. which worked out fine.

2. In your reflection, you noted that you didn't have moments of emotional connection or self-awareness today. Can you explore why that might have been the case? Did the excitement or stress of preparing and traveling to Defqon.1 play a role?

I think this is a broughter issue. I have a hard time connecting with my emotions. I think I need to work on this.
