# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-07-10

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I rated the day a 6 and had macaroni for dinner. I was late for work, arriving at 10:15. My morning was spent mostly on Reddit, followed by an afternoon meeting with the product owner and user of my new project. After work, I worked on importing laz files into Reality Capture and watched a movie in the evening. During a moment of strong emotions in the evening, I reflected on my ongoing struggle with energy since Defqon and my dissatisfaction with my current life state, feeling overwhelmed and lacking control despite being productive. I compared myself to my late father, who always seemed to have everything under control, and realized I miss him. Plans for tomorrow include calling the psychologist for an appointment and starting my first day on the new project.
