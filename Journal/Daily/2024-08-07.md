# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-08-07

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had wraps and gave the day a grade of 7. I was on time for work but didn't shower, planning to do so the next morning. Throughout the day, I worked on IBIS maintenance and started on WANDA. After work, I played Horizon Forbidden West both in the afternoon and evening. I learned about cognitive behavior therapy and a peculiar eyeball therapy from the psychologist. I pondered about needing more active relaxation, possibly incorporating OSM, and reflected on discovering my core values. For plans, I have a UI meeting for WANDA and need to remember to take Monday off next week.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned learning about cognitive behavior therapy and a type of "weird eyeball therapy." Can you elaborate on what you found interesting or puzzling about these therapies and how you think they might help you?

2. In your dump section, you wrote about trying to find a balance between active relaxing and productivity. Could you describe what your ideal balance would look like and any specific steps you're considering to achieve that balance?

3. You noted the importance of discovering your core values but seemed uncertain about how to start. Can you detail any strategies or methods you are thinking about trying to identify these core values, or what obstacles you anticipate in this discovery process?
