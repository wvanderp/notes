# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-07-17

## Summary of yesterday's entry

I spent the day in Middelburg, which included getting towed there in the morning, shopping in the afternoon, and visiting the abbey. I felt somewhat emotional due to frequently joking about my deceased father, and I also noticed my brother was sad but wasn't sure how to help. In the evening, I participated in a camp activity called "doop." I felt a bit disconnected as ChatGPT wasn't useful for the activity. I learned that one of the registrars of an organ is called Quint and have planned a busy morning with quidditch followed by a lazy afternoon while the children hike. Throughout the day, I aimed to balance giving and taking in my interactions and reflected on how I might improve my communication and leadership skills. My grade for the day was a 6.
