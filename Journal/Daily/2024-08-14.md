# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-08-14

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had spaghetti for dinner and graded the day a B+. I was on time for work and took a shower. In the morning, I completed a client presentation and handled emails. The afternoon involved team meetings and progress reviews. After work, I attended a local community event and read a book in the evening. Emotionally, I felt more attuned and responsive today, particularly during the community event. A significant moment of pride was wrapping up the client presentation confidently, which felt more impactful than yesterday’s sense of accomplishment. I prioritized self-care by reading, compared to yesterday’s workout, and this helped me unwind effectively. A worthwhile activity was networking at the community event, enhancing personal growth like the previous day's gym session. A bad habit was procrastination, countered by structured breaks, which felt more effective than yesterday's vaguely defined effort. I plan to finish an important report and continue networking efforts tomorrow.
