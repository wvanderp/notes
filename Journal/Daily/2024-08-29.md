## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday's dinner was chicken from Ikea, and the day was rated a 7, despite being late to work due to traffic.

After work, the user purchased and built a new closet from Ikea. Reflections touched on the complexity of solving the "five rules of Wanda," recognizing the importance of self-care through organization, and the tiresome nature of daily chores like cleaning. Bad habits like staying up late were noted, but TikTok usage was under control. Progress was made in purchasing a closet, with plans to buy a suit tomorrow. Key learnings included the ease of building Ikea furniture, the weakness of recently removed sutures, and the importance of a good API.
