# Journal entry for Sunday, 2024-09-01

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday, I had pasta for dinner and rated the day a solid 7 out of 10. In the morning, I finished setting up my new IKEA closet, which significantly improved my space organization despite the minor challenge of figuring out the assembly instructions. In the afternoon, I focused on implementing one of Wanda's Five Rules—staying consistent—which has been beneficial for maintaining my routines. I also tried new efficient cleaning strategies, like using a multipurpose cleaner that streamlined my chores and saved time. In the evening, I assessed my bedtime management plan; though I struggled with a few triggers that delayed my bedtime, I began identifying these patterns to address them. Emotionally, I felt more balanced than the previous day, with a proud moment being my successful organization of the closet, which boosted my productivity. I managed to balance helping a friend with taking a moment for self-care, which felt rewarding. I accomplished planning my week ahead, aligning with my goals for better time management. I tackled procrastination, using a timer technique that worked well but had room for improvement. For tomorrow, I plan to fine-tune my bedtime routine and continue refining my cleaning strategies.
