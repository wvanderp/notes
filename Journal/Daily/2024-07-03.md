# Journal entry for Wednesday, 2024-07-03

## Summary of yesterday's entry

Yesterday's journal entries reflect on attending Defqon.1, where, despite being tired, I enjoyed the experience, watched many artists, and interacted with people, capturing photos and videos. I noted the need to summarize missed days on the 4th. On July 1st, I struggled with exhaustion while packing and driving home for a 1 PM meeting. On July 2nd, I was still tired during the meeting and began working on a side project, fixing GitJournal in Dart, as I was between projects at work.

## Questions about yesterday

1. You mentioned seeing many artists at Defqon.1. Which performances stood out most and why? Can you describe specific moments or songs that significantly impacted your experience?

Noisecontrollers was a classic set from when I was first introduced to hardstyle in 2012.

The main artist I wanted to see was GPF, but I was disappointed by their set. It needed to be more piep kicks, short and messy.

I also liked feeling the bass in my chest. This is the main reason I like hardstyle and other hard music.

2. You noted feeling tired during Defqon.1 and in the days following. Can you elaborate on how the exhaustion affected your mood and interactions with others? Did it change your enjoyment of the festival or your productivity at work?

I definitely enjoyed the festival less because of my exhaustion. The main culprit was my neighbors, who played speedcore deep in the night. But it was already a trend in my life that I was tired.

3. Regarding your side project on fixing GitJournal in Dart, can you provide more details about what this project involves? What challenges did you face with the new programming language, and what progress did you make before your motivation waned?

I use Gitjournal to write this journal. But it contains a bug that restores files that are deleted externally. The developer said he would be right on it but then did not do anything. So, I decided to fix it myself. I started by fixing the CI/CD pipeline. It was not updated in a while and did not work anymore. Some of the tests were broken, so I needed to fix them, and then I saw that to test some parts, I needed to implement a new feature. So I started on that. I made some progress, but it was hard work, and I was not motivated to continue.
