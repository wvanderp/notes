# Journal entry for Friday, 2024-08-02

## Summary of yesterday's entry

For dinner, I had pasta, and I would grade the day as a B+. I wasn't on time for work and managed to shower before heading out. My morning consisted of meetings, while the afternoon was spent on project work. After work, I hit the gym, and in the evening, I enjoyed a quiet night reading. Key moments of self-awareness involved staying calm during a stressful meeting which positively influenced my day, and successfully completing a challenging task increased my sense of self-worth. I focused on my needs by taking a short break when feeling overwhelmed, which helped maintain a better sense of balance. I considered my gym workout worthwhile for my personal growth. I worked on reducing procrastination by setting timers but found it challenging to stick to; tomorrow, I plan to use a stricter schedule.
