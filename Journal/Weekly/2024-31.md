# Weekly summary of week 31 of 2024

## Summary

Throughout the past seven days, life has been a mix of work, self-care, personal growth, social activities, and dealing with emotional challenges. Coming back from camp on July 22nd, I began the week feeling drained but quickly shifted back into work mode. The start of the week involved psychological evaluations, which confirmed my autism diagnosis. This added another layer to understanding myself and brought some emotional weight.

Certain days were less eventful, such as on July 23rd, but bright spots included successfully introducing a new game mode to my friends on the 24th. The first meeting with my psychologist on the 25th was particularly draining yet constructive. It marked a positive step forward, despite being emotionally taxing, further complicated by the task of cleaning my late grandmother’s house.

Work was demanding, highlighted by a detailed project presentation on the 26th. Over the weekend, obligations, like helping build a clubhouse, were balanced with attempts at rest and relaxation. Sunday was mixed, featuring both productive work and restful moments. This week I aimed to create stability at work and planned for quiet evenings.

The beginning of the following week saw dining at McDonald's while completing some admin tasks and working through a high-priority login issue. Feelings of impostor syndrome surfaced but quickly dissipated as I applied my skills in SQL, C#, and Azure to solve the problem successfully. This achievement helped bolster my confidence. The following day was less productive, with a lot of time spent watching the Olympics and gaming, which served as a necessary recharge. However, I wrestled with limiting my short-form video consumption and recognized the need for stronger measures.

Mid-week, on Wednesday, I maintained a more balanced day, focusing on productive tasks, working on a project presentation, and integrating exercise into my routine. This structure contributed positively to my sense of self-worth and overall balance. On Thursday, continued efforts to maintain productivity and manage time effectively resulted in a satisfying day. Emotional highs included realizing personal growth through effective project management and gym sessions.

Friday wrapped up the workweek with a continued focus on project work, successful presentations, and physical exercise, culminating in a peaceful evening with a book. Challenges included balancing procrastination tendencies with structured approaches like to-do lists, which saw moderate success.

The overarching theme or lesson from this week centers around balancing self-care with productivity and understanding personal limits. Each day brought its unique challenges and rewards, but understanding when to push forward and when to allow oneself time to recharge proved crucial. Addressing emotional and psychological needs while continuing to meet work and social obligations taught me the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing what matters most. By striking this equilibrium, I’m learning that progress is not just measured in achievements but also in taking care of oneself holistically.
