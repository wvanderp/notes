# Weekly summary of week 29 of 2024

## Summary

Reflecting on the past week, my days were filled with significant events and emotional highs and lows. At the summer camp, I experienced moments of genuine joy, particularly while engaging with the children in various activities like playing the sorting hat and "lijntjes tekenen." These activities brought out my love for acting and the joy of seeing the children puzzle through the game, even when they made mistakes or got frustrated.

On July 13, a critical situation unfolded on the Oosterschelde when our shipâ€™s motor failed, putting us in potential danger. Detaching a motorboat to set a course to safety, I felt a heavy burden, sensing a gut-wrenching feeling of abandoning the main ship and the children. Though we managed to ensure everyone's safety with the help of emergency services, this incident has had a lingering impact on me.

July 18 brought an unexpected early departure from camp due to bad weather, triggering a cascade of emotions: sadness for missing the remaining camp activities, a sense of abandonment towards my fellow scouts, and a general feeling of unpreparedness for the sudden change. Emotional expression and engaging in activities helped me navigate through this turmoil.

Returning home on July 21, I quickly slipped back into my pre-camp habits. Noticing how easily I defaulted to activities like endlessly watching Instagram reels, neglecting the little things, and reverting to old eating and drinking patterns, I recognized the need for positive changes.

Throughout the week, I found moments of pride and self-validation, especially in how I handled the crisis on the Oosterschelde and maintained a calm demeanor. I realized the importance of preparation and effective action in stressful situations.

The overarching theme or lesson I learned from this week is the importance of resilience and the need for a balanced approach to self-care and responsibility. While being there for others is crucial, I also need to prioritize my well-being to sustain my ability to lead and support. Recognizing and embracing positive habits from enriching experiences like camp can significantly improve the quality of daily life.

## Therapists Opinion

Based on your journal entries from the past week, I can see that you've experienced quite a mix of emotions, ranging from fear and anxiety to pride and reflection. Here are my thoughts on your mental state and well-being:

### Navigating High-Stress Situations

Your experience on July 13, with the ship's engine failure, was a significant stress point. You found yourself in a high-pressure situation where the safety of many children was at stake. Despite the initial fear and sense of abandonment, you handled it competently and stayed calm under stress. This indicates strong problem-solving skills and leadership qualities, but it's clear that you're still processing the emotional impact.

You mentioned feeling like you prioritized things over people, which can be a heavy burden to carry, especially when you value putting people first. It's important to recognize that, in emergencies, quick decisions have to be made, and you did what was necessary to ensure overall safety. It's also perfectly okay to feel shaken by the event; your acknowledgment shows a deep sense of responsibility and empathy.

### Emotional Reactions and Processing Trauma

The early departure from camp on July 18 triggered sadness and panic. You've identified multiple reasons for these feelings, ranging from missing out on activities to a sense of abandonment. The experience of leaving camp early due to potential danger tied back to the trauma of the boat incident. This compound emotional response is understandable given the context.

It was helpful that engaging in activities and seeking clarity from others helped you manage your emotions. This shows a proactive approach to emotional regulation, which is a positive sign of resilience.

### Post-Camp Reflection and Habits

Post-camp on July 21, you observed a quick return to pre-camp habits that you consider negative, such as watching a lot of instant videos and not paying attention to the little things. This self-awareness is an essential first step towards making positive changes. It seems that camp provided a structured, fulfilling environment, and the transition back to everyday life has highlighted areas for growth.

### Key Observations

1. **Emotional Intelligence**: You show a high level of emotional intelligence by identifying your feelings and the reasons behind them. This will be beneficial in processing your experiences and making positive changes.
   
2. **Leadership Skills**: Your ability to manage stressful situations and provide leadership is commendable. However, it's also essential to address any lingering feelings of guilt or fear stemming from these experiences.
   
3. **Self-Awareness and Growth**: You are keenly aware of your habits and the areas where you want to improve. The initiative to reflect and the desire to make positive changes are crucial for personal growth.

### Recommendations

1. **Allow Yourself to Process the Trauma**: It might be helpful to discuss the boat incident with a counselor or therapist. Sometimes externalizing these experiences and getting a professional perspective can significantly aid in processing trauma.

2. **Embrace Your Emotions**: Allow yourself to feel and process your emotions about leaving camp early. Writing or talking about these feelings can provide clarity and comfort.

3. **Develop a Plan for Positive Habits**: Create a realistic plan to incorporate the positive behaviors you experienced at camp into your daily routine. Start small, with one or two changes, and gradually build on them. 

4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Give yourself credit for the small achievements, like constructing the scraper or staying calm during the boat incident. Celebrating these can provide motivation and a sense of accomplishment.

Overall, your reflections show a deep capacity for empathy, leadership, and personal growth. It's clear that you care deeply about your role at camp and the well-being of those around you. Lean into these qualities as you work on developing sustainable positive habits and processing your recent experiences.
