# Weekly summary of week 27 of 2024

## Summary

In the past week, many events have significantly impacted my experiences, reflections, and learning. I attended Defqon.1, enjoying the music and interactions despite feeling fatigue due to neighbors playing speedcore late into the night. This exhaustion affected my enjoyment and productivity, causing struggles during the subsequent days, especially on July 1st and 2nd. A side project to fix GitJournal in Dart presented challenges and highlighted the intricacies of working with a new programming language and the necessary motivation to continue.

By July 3rd, I realized the need to work on motivation and set achievable goals, preparing for a meeting with my manager and clearing out my grandma’s house. This meeting on July 4th served as a boost to my self-worth and professional confidence, furthering my assertiveness skills, and demonstrating I can effectively communicate my needs in a professional setting. The evening was spent productively helping with the house, bringing a sense of accomplishment.

On July 5th, I engaged with a new project at work and, despite not starting the day on a high note, transformed it into a productive and educational experience by delving into the code and skipping a social event to prioritize work I enjoyed. This day was marked by a mix of emotional neutrality and pride in my professional competencies.

Finally, July 6th was a much-deserved day of rest and physical activities, cleaning the house and enjoying time with the EK quarter-finals. Despite a different form of tiredness, involving a mental rather than physical fatigue, I found satisfaction in household accomplishments, understanding the need for balance between personal desires and necessary tasks.

The overarching theme this week is balancing productivity and rest while understanding the importance of self-awareness and assertiveness in personal and professional growth. This involves recognizing when to push forward despite fatigue, setting achievable goals, and being willing to prioritize necessary self-care and substantial work to foster both immediate and long-term accomplishments.

## Therapists Opinion

From your journal entries over the past few days, it's clear you've been navigating a period of significant activity and reflection, managing both personal and professional responsibilities. Let's dive into some key observations regarding your mental state and well-being:

1. **Exhaustion and Recovery:** Throughout your entries, you repeatedly mention feelings of exhaustion and the impact of physical and mental fatigue from events like Defqon.1. It's entirely natural to feel drained after such intensive experiences. You show awareness of how this exhaustion affects your productivity and mood, which is an essential first step toward managing it better. It might be beneficial to explore strategies for recuperating more effectively, such as prioritizing rest and gradually easing back into demanding tasks.

2. **Productivity and Motivation:** There's a recurring theme of grappling with productivity and motivation. You seem to set high expectations for yourself, aiming to complete significant projects despite feeling drained. Understanding the scope and difficulty of your tasks—like your GitJournal project—allows you to set more realistic goals. Recognizing that progress can be incremental and celebrating small victories could help sustain your motivation.

3. **Professional Development:** You've demonstrated a strong commitment to your professional growth. Your work on your resume, your proactive approach to new projects, and your interaction with your manager all reflect a dedication to advancing your career. The fact that your manager supports you, as evidenced by the company funding a temporary psychologist, is a positive sign. It suggests you are valued at work, which should affirm your self-worth and encourage you to continue voicing your needs.

4. **Balancing Assertiveness and Social Interactions:** It's encouraging to see you becoming more assertive, as seen in your decision to ensure a timely meeting with your manager. Conversely, your choice to skip a social event to focus on work you find enjoyable indicates a need for balance. While it's important to seize networking opportunities, prioritizing your mental well-being and work satisfaction is also valid. Over time, finding a balance between social engagements and personal preferences will likely enhance your overall job satisfaction and relationships with colleagues.

5. **Emotional Awareness and Reflection:** You show a high level of self-awareness, continuously reflecting on your feelings and actions. Even when emotions are neutral, your capacity to articulate why you feel a certain way is a valuable tool for personal growth. For instance, recognizing feelings of pride from your professional accomplishments or reflecting on family connections at your grandmother's house demonstrates meaningful introspection.

6. **Achieving Work-Life Balance:** Your reflections on balancing personal and professional tasks, as well as managing self-care, illustrate the ongoing struggle many people face. While you prioritize productivity and responsibility, remember that self-care activities, like watching movies or engaging in physical tasks, are equally important. They recharge you and maintain your overall well-being.

**Moving Forward:**

1. **Set Small, Achievable Goals:** To combat feelings of unaccomplishment, break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Celebrate these small successes to keep motivation high.

2. **Prioritize Rest and Recovery:** Incorporate rest periods, especially after intense activities or busy weekends. Your recognition of needing a balance is crucial—listening to your body and mind will prevent burnout.

3. **Seek Support When Needed:** Your openness to using resources like ChatGPT for resume writing and the willingness to accept professional psychological support shows you understand the value of seeking help. Continue utilizing available resources to ease your journey.

4. **Maintain Self-Care Routines:** Balance work projects with activities that bring joy and relaxation, whether it's watching movies, spending time outside, or engaging in hobbies.

5. **Experiment with Balance:** Keep experimenting with the balance between social obligations and personal time. Both are important, and finding the right mix will contribute to your overall happiness and success.

You're on a solid path of self-awareness and growth. By continuing to reflect on and adjust your actions and mindset, you're likely to foster a healthier, more balanced mental state.
