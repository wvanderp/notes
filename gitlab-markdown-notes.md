## draw.io files

I did some research and there are a few thing needed to make this work.
 
1. you need to save the diagram as a file.drawio.svg file. if you dont have this extention gitlab will not recognise it
1. the svg needs to be a special drawio svg which includes drawio metadata in the svg. you can create or edit in other editors
1. you need to use the rich text editor to see the button to edit the files. in the screenshot below you see the button to switch if you need to do so

ps. some of the files are secretly already drawio files. so if you used the png export of drawio then the meta data might be included in the png
