# Ideas for my funeral

The fire was always burning

Some sad inappropriate music

Take a Group picture. Because all the people that were important toe should be there.

Put something weird in the casket that will confused the archiligists. Like a knife

Sing a song with everyone

Give away my stuff to people that need it. To me these are mostly tools.

If you can find somebody Technical. Release my data to the internet. Upload my intire Nas. Maybe get /r/datahorders involved

Put a little piece in the paper

I don't have a preference in burry or crimation although I like the idea of perminance of grave. But crimation forces you to move on
