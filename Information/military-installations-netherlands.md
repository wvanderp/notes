# military installations in the Netherlands

All military installations can be found in the following law:

[Artikel 2.41 Omgevingsregeling](https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0045528&hoofdstuk=2&afdeling=2.6&artikel=2.41&z=2024-01-01&g=2024-01-01)


This was previously [Regeling algemene regels ruimtelijke ordening](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0031018/2021-07-01) but got replaced by the new law.

this new law does include machinereadble geomity for the bases so that nice

the old law was been copied but the new law can be imported so I should look into that.
OSM has been copying this document to their database and is currently at: Bijlage 1.33.
