In a silent disco, the music is transmitted to the headphones of the visitors. This way, the visitors can choose which music they want to listen to. The headphones have a switch to select the desired channel. The headphones are equipped with a receiver that receives the music from a transmitter. The transmitter is connected to the audio source, such as a DJ set or a music player. The transmitter sends the music to the headphones on different frequencies. This way, multiple channels can be transmitted simultaneously.
