## be now sample

There is a sample I first heard in a set of `Charlotte de Witte`

The song was `Cosmic sequencer by Pawlowski`

It goes like `everybody... be now`

I then found it again in a mix on `Keeping the rave alive` [`Episode 624: Club Kinetic`](https://www.keepingtheravealive.com/podcast/episode-624)

There it was in a song: [`A Sense Of Summer - On Top (Hixxy '97 Mix)`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftjlA3T9IIk)  which is a remix of [`A Sense Of Summer - On Top`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubSjZVh7rs) which used the same sample.

I could not find any more information
