# Emergency kit

When a societal glitch occurs, the importance of having an emergency kit to sustain us for a week in our home cannot be overstated.

This list is aimed at a family of 3 in the Netherlands.

It's essential that the kit is stored in a place that is easy to reach and carry. Regular checks, every six months, are necessary to ensure that everything is still in working order. This proactive approach will keep you prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.

These societal glitches, which we must be prepared for, could disrupt our daily lives in various ways:

- power outage
- water outage
- food shortage
- gas outage
- Internet outage
- phone outage
- etc.
