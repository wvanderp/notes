# DND Ideas

This is one of my favorite D&D puzzles.
A mirror with a magical aura.
If the players try to pass through it,
they will be blocked by their own reflection.
But instead of cool glass,
they feel their own skin on the other side.
If they inspect the reflection and get a good dice roll,
they'll see something that's not in the room with them.
Maybe a key.
They can use their reflection to pick up the key
and throw it through the mirror,
bringing it to the real world.
Another fun, more sinister thing you can add to this
is if the players try to break the mirror,
then maybe their reflection gets angry
and starts attacking one of your party members' reflections.
And maybe that damage transfers to the real world.
You can change up this puzzle however you like.
Give it a go.

Here's an NPC for your next session.
When the players roll initiative, they are suddenly joined on the battlefield by a mysterious, heavily armored paladin known only as The Judge.
Of course, he doesn't appear in a magical cloud or some sparkly flourish.
Instead, he comes stumbling out of nearby bushes, pulling twigs from his armor.
Or, if the players are in a dungeon, he comes crashing through the stone wall, Kool-Aid Man style.
Once he is on the battlefield, The Judge blows his whistle.
The player who rolled the lowest initiative must roll a d20 to determine The Judge's rule for combat.
Possible rules can include things like no ranged weapons, no conjuration, and no moving more than 10 feet at a time.
If any creature breaks the rule, they are given a red card by The Judge and a fitting punishment.
For example, failure to follow the no moving more than 10 feet at a time rule transforms the guilty party's legs into tree trunks, rendering them immobile for the duration of the battle.
Of course, for additional strategy, The Roll can also include something.
The Judge wants to see, like item use or knock targets prone.
Performing one of these actions earns a non-stackable green card that works like a d4 bardic inspiration die.
What rules would you include in The Judge's table? Let us know in the comments below.

I love weak magic items. Complex and powerful magic items are great, but clever trinkets can show up anywhere, and they're a fun source of world building. 

My favorite resource for years has been this simple website by a thoughtful DM named Len.

Select an item type, how many you want,and roll the dice. I have used this as the starting point for so many magic items in my games.

The Bearer of the Vigilant Ring gains plus two to their passive perception. Once attuned, the Bearer always knows the exact location of this amulet. 

These are so great for sparking new item ideas.

Len has also provided a view of the tables that power these random items, if you want to read through that. It's a wonderful little site. So thank you, Len, wherever you are. 

Your weak magic items have helped to fill the pockets and the treasure chests and the tombs that my players have enjoyed looting for years.

The Reaper's Quiver gives advantage on death saving throws.

It just makes me want to write the lore behind an item like that. Who owned it? So cool.
Thanks for watching!
