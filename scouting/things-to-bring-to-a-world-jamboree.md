# things that you should bring to the world jamboree

Besides all the things you would bring to a normal jamboree, there are a few things you should bring to a world jamboree.

- A flag from your country or region. There are multiple places that can contain a flag. For example, you need a flag for your campsite or your subcamp to wear during the opening, or maybe some meme pops up.
- Lots of badges. You will be trading badges with people from all over the world. So bring lots of badges. You can also bring some badges specific to your country or region. You can easily swap contingent badges for other contingent badges. But you can also swap badges from your country or region for badges from other countries or regions.
- A big daily backpack. You will be walking a lot. So you will need a backpack to carry all your stuff. But you will also need a backpack to carry everything you get from other people. So bring a big backpack.

## things not to bring

- Any clothes that are not contingent or scout-related. You will be wearing your contingent uniform most of the time. So you don't need any other clothes. And you don't want to carry around a lot of clothes.
