# Scout stock game

In this game the scouts are challenged to earn money on the stock market. Each scout has there own account and will make there own trades.

There is an analog way of playing. There could also be a digital version.

In the analog version you just screen where a special video is playing. This video shows 4 candle charts of stocks. Over the span of a hour the charts will change.

Then the scouts get x around of fake money to buy and sell the stocks with. This is done by going to the trading table were a leader will sell or buy a stock for the current market price.

At the end of the game all stocks are worth the closing price. And the person with the most money wins.

You can add a lesson by having a leader buy stock with there Money and not trading and coming out ok.

The digital version needs a phone and a web app and will take a lot of work to develop. So it does not seam worth it.
