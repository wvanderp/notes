# Hay fever

I suffer from a medium to severe case of hay fever. This means that I have a runny nose, itchy eyes, and a sore throat. This is a problem because it makes me less productive and less happy.

I have tried a few things to combat this, and I will document them here.

## masks

An N95 mask seems to help with hay fever symptoms. Although now, you have the trade between reduced symptoms and the discomfort of wearing a mask.

Also, people will associate the mask with covid-19, but they accept it when you tell them it's for hay fever.

## Hay fever tablets and sprays

I have tried a few hay fever tablets, and they all seem to work somewhat.

When I was young, my GP prescribed [Nasonex](https://www.apotheek.nl/medicijnen/mometason-neusspray?product=nasonex) nasal spray, which worked well, I think. But this can also be the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. The active ingredient in Nasonex is mometasone.

In the past, I used [`Prevalin Allerstop cetirizine`](https://www.prevalin.nl/product/allerstop-tabletten/), which worked ok. then I switched to [`Etos Hooikoortstabletten Cetirizine`](https://www.etos.nl/producten/etos-hooikoortstabletten-cetirizine-dihci-10-mg-10-stuks-112007830.html) which also worked ok-ish. However, both did not work as well as I would have liked. I still had all the symptoms, and I would still be debilitated after prolonged exposure.

from further investigation, I seams that the dosage on the packaging is there for a reason. I was taking 2 tablets a day, but the recommended dosage is 1 tablet a day. So I tried taking 1 tablet a day, and it worked better. I still had symptoms, but they were less severe.

So, in conclusion, some more experimentation is needed to detain the right medication for me.
