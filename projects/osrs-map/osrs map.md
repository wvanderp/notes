# OSRS Map

The idea here is to recreate the map view from old school runescape from scratch and then integrate other features into it.

The steps are:

- Parse the osrs cache to get the map and position of entities
- Render the base map
- Find the add the positions of the entries to the map
- Make a web app to show it

## Current problems

How the hell do we work the the caches
