# building a adsb recever server

## hardware

### raspberry pi

any raspberry pi should work. but make sure you have a good power supply.

### rtl-sdr stick

there seam to be two good choices.

- [flightaware pro stick](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/prostick/)
- [adsbexchange blue](https://store.adsbexchange.com/products/adsbexchange-com-r820t2-rtl2832u-0-5-ppm-tcxo-ads-b-sdr-w-amp-and-1090-mhz-filter-software-on-industrial-microsd)

both should work.

### antenna

## software

it seems like the `adsbx` client can be ran on any Linux.

## need

it seams like there is already a feeder in my area.

although there are also aircraft like this:

maybe i should make a poc with some hardware i have laying around to see if i can provide any value.
