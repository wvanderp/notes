# Ideas for my funeral

## The funeral

In general a normal funeral is ok.

Don't be afraid to play some inappropriate music for a funeral. aka don't limit yourself to the funeral 500.

Take a Group picture because all the people that were significant to me should be there. And there are never any photos from funerals.

Put something weird in the casket that will confuse the archeologists. Like a knife

Sing a song with everyone.

Put a little piece in the newspaper.

I don't have a preference for burry or cremation, although I like the idea of the permanence of the grave. But cremation forces you to move on

I like for everybody to bring a literal stick

## After the funeral

Give away my stuff to people who need it. I consider most of my stuff tools and tools need to be used,

Suppose you can find somebody Technical. Release my data to the internet. Upload my entire Nas. Maybe get `/r/datahorders` involved.
