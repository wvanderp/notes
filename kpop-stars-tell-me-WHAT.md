# Kpop stars tell me WHAT?

there are many songs where they ask a english question and then answer it in korean. This realy bugs me. I want to know what they are saying. So I'm going to find out.

## ITZY - DALLA DALLA

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNfTK39k55U>

> People look at me, and they tell me
> 외모만 보고 내가 날라리 같대요 (no, no)

which translates to:

> People look at me, and they tell me
> They say I'm a rascal just by looking at my appearance (no, no)

translations vary between: freak, rascal, and punk.

## TWICE - Dance the Night Away

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm5iP0S1z9w>

> If you wanna have some fun, 짭짤한 공기처럼

they don't tell me how to have fun. so translate it is:

> If you wanna have some fun, like the salty air

this makes even less sense. salty air is not fun. it's just salty.

although chatgpt informs us that `salty` can be interpreted as excited.

## Everglow - Adios

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gX_p1VkgA4>

> I just wanna let you know 내 두 눈에 띄지 않게

she just wants to let me know. but what?

> I just wanna let you know, so you won't stand out in my eyes

this line implies that the write has lost interest in the person they are singing about.

## TWICE - What is Love?

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0p1bmr0EmE>

> I wanna know 사탕처럼 달콤하다는데
> I wanna know 하늘을 나는 것 같다는데
> I wanna know 하루 종일 웃고 있다는데
> I wanna know 세상이 다 아름답다는데

beside the bigger question of what is love, they also want to know a lot of other things.

> I wanna know, they say it's sweet like candy
> I wanna know, they say it feels like flying in the sky
> I wanna know, they say they smile all day
> I wanna know, they say the world is beautiful

as for the main question, they don't answer it. they just want to know, know, know, know. What is love?

but chatgpt theories:

> The song "What is Love?" by Twice is expressing the curiosity and yearning to understand and experience love. The lyrics reflect the desire to know what love feels like, how it manifests, and when it might come into one's life. The song portrays love as something sweet, exciting, and beautiful, akin to the sensation of candy or soaring through the sky. It explores the anticipation of love and the eagerness to embrace it when it arrives, emphasizing the joy and happiness it brings. Ultimately, the main question of the song revolves around understanding the essence and sensation of love, and eagerly awaiting its arrival in one's life.

## MAMAMOO - HIP

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhTeiaCezwM>

> All I wanna be is 멋짐

all she wants to be is 멋짐. but what is 멋짐?

> All I wanna be is cool

>I love you 네가 뭐라든 간에

> I love you, no matter what you say

## BTS - ugh!

> Can I UGH! Can I UGH! Can I UGH! Can I UGH!

they want to know if they can UGH!
