# Songs that I want in my epic movie

There is nothing better than having a fantastic song in your movie.

But what if the entire movie consists of nothing but excellent songs that drive the story.

This list has songs that can be incredible movie scenes.

## The Kyteman Orchestra - The Mushroom Cloud

With this number, I imagine a general like George Washington in Hamilton giving a speech surrounded by his soldiers. The soldiers respect him and would, and did, follow him to the end of the world.

In the first part of the speech, he talks about the mistakes he made that have led them to the predicament that they are currently in. The soldiers are a bit bitter that it has to end, but they understand his mistakes because they would have made the same mistakes.

In the second part of the song, it's revealed that besides the commanding officer, he also seems to be the group's spiritual leader. It's revealed that their borrowed time on earth has run out and that the owner of the time has come to collect. We never see the owner of the time, but we notice his presence. The wind starts weeping up the dust collected in this old warehouse. Light shines through the windows. The wind catches the light, and it starts twirling around the general and his man. 

The speech and apology resonate with the men because they start to chant with the song, supporting the pleas of the general. Slowly, the general stars walk towards the light, and his man follows him. The general seems to be stepping further than is allowed by the room's physical dimensions.

The light gets a bit brighter as the men disappear into the light, as if the bodies of the men strengthen the light. Then the music dies down. The light eliminating what seemed to be the whole city cut out at once, and the only thing we saw was some dust settling in the now empty warehouse.

We hang a moment in utter silence to get the impact of the loss we have suffered with our victory over the general.
