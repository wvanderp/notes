I have this dry cough. When I cough nothing comes up. Also my longs itch a bit.
Might be un related but my sleep schedule is fucked. I now sleep at 130 on work days

I still have the cough. The longs still itch and I still go to bed at 0100

I also want to report that sometimes my right pinky too loses feeling or feels numb.
