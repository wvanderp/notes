# quick notes

a place to quickly jot down some notes.

## wanted camera specs

for My trip in Japan. I want to have a new camera and I have a few things that I want to for the camera to have.

must have

- 30+ mega pixels
- small "mirror less" body
  - id doen not actually have to be mirror less

  nice to have

  - not cannon
  - change able lenses

The Main thing is that I want to have very sharp photos where you can zoom in a lot not only to get the framing right but also to see the smallest features so that it can do photogrammary very well

an additional thing us tat i want a way to keep the camera close by. its a chore to get the camera out of the bag. and thus you will not take as many photos. so a nice harnass or hoster will also be needed

## asserto zuidland

i think that it would be fun to have a virtual race track of my village.

but there are a few things that need to happen befor i can make that.

get reffrence matiral
learn to make a race track

ive devices the follown  wat of making refrence matirial.

drone flights
biking with a dslr
gopro on a stick pointing at the ground.
360 cam on head

but most of these methods need good light so it will have to wait till spring.
