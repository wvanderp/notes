  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
  - 1 teaspoon paprika
  - 1 teaspoon salt (divided)
  - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper (divided)
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil

- **For the Pasta and Sauce:**
  - 300g spaghetti
  - 1 medium onion (about 150g), diced
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 150g mushrooms, sliced
  - 1 jar (190g) pesto sauce
  - 200ml heavy cream
  - 100g fresh spinach leaves
  - Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

1. **Preparation (15 minutes):**
   - **Boil Water for Pasta:**
     - Fill a large pot with 4 liters of water.
     - Add 1 tablespoon of salt.
     - Place over high heat to bring to a boil (this will take about 10 minutes).
   - **Prepare Ingredients:**
     - Season the chicken breasts on both sides with:
       - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
       - 1 teaspoon paprika
       - 1/2 teaspoon salt
       - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
     - Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and slice the mushrooms.
     - Rinse the spinach and set aside.
     - Measure out the pesto and heavy cream.

2. **Cook the Spaghetti (10 minutes):**
   - Once the water is boiling, add 300g of spaghetti.
   - Stir immediately to prevent sticking.
   - Cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually 8-10 minutes).
   - Before draining, reserve 120ml (1/2 cup) of the pasta cooking water.
   - Drain the spaghetti and set aside.

3. **Cook the Chicken (15 minutes):**
   - While the pasta cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
   - Add the seasoned chicken breasts to the pan.
   - Cook for 6-8 minutes on each side, or until:
     - The internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F).
     - The chicken is no longer pink inside.
   - Remove the chicken from the pan.
   - Place on a cutting board and cover with foil to rest.

4. **Sauté the Vegetables (8 minutes):**
   - In the same pan (do not clean it), add the diced onion.
   - Sauté over medium heat for 3 minutes until translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms.
   - Continue to sauté for an additional 5 minutes until:
     - Mushrooms are softened.
     - Any excess liquid has evaporated.

5. **Prepare the Creamy Pesto Sauce (5 minutes):**
   - Reduce the heat to low.
   - Add the entire 190g jar of pesto to the pan.
   - Stir well to combine with the vegetables.
   - Pour in 200ml of heavy cream.
   - Stir continuously until the sauce is smooth and begins to simmer gently (do not let it boil).
   - Season the sauce with:
     - Remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.
     - Additional salt to taste (start with 1/4 teaspoon).

6. **Add Spinach to the Sauce (2 minutes):**
   - Add the 100g of fresh spinach leaves to the pan.
   - Stir until the spinach has wilted completely.

7. **Combine Everything (5 minutes):**
   - Slice the rested chicken breasts into thin strips.
   - Add the sliced chicken to the sauce.
   - Add the cooked spaghetti to the pan.
   - Gently toss everything together over low heat.
   - If the sauce is too thick, gradually add the reserved pasta water (a few tablespoons at a time) until desired consistency is reached.

8. **Serve (2 minutes):**
   - Divide the creamy pesto chicken spaghetti evenly among serving plates.
   - Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
   - Serve immediately while hot.

**Total Time:** Approximately 40 minutes

## Notes

- **Cooking Times:** Actual cooking times may vary slightly based on your stove and cookware.
- **Pasta Water:** The reserved pasta water contains starch, which helps the sauce adhere better to the pasta.
- **Adjusting Seasoning:** Always taste the sauce before serving and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
- **Storage:** Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

Enjoy your meal!
