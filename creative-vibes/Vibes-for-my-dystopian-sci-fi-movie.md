# Vibes for my dystopian sci-fi movie

## Visuals

One of the vibes important to this movie is conflict. So, one of the themes can be progressive vs. conservative. Do we lean into technology or humanity, and what happens when one side dives into the other domain?

There are a few excellent concepts in this video clip. Like the same mysterious entity reoccurring in many historical settings. The way color red highlights the presence of this entity.

Every shot is the best version of the shot. There is movement, cool visuals, and a story in every shot.

## Music

There is nothing better than having a fantastic song in your movie.

But what if the entire movie consists of nothing but excellent songs that drive the story?

This list has songs that can be incredible movie scenes.

### Evanescence - Going Under

### The Kyteman Orchestra - The Mushroom Cloud

With this number, I imagine a general like George Washington in Hamilton giving a speech surrounded by his soldiers. The soldiers respect him and would, and did, follow him to the end of the world.

In the first part of the speech, he talks about the mistakes he made that have led them to the predicament that they are currently in. The soldiers are a bit bitter that it has to end, but they understand his mistakes because they would have made the same mistakes.

In the song's second part, it's revealed that besides the commanding officer, he also seems to be the group's spiritual leader. It's revealed that their borrowed time on earth has run out and that the owner of the time has come to collect. We never see the owner of the time, but we notice his presence. The wind starts weeping up the dust collected in this old warehouse. Light shines through the windows. The wind catches the light, twirling around the general and his man.

The speech and apology resonate with the men because they start to chant with the song, supporting the pleas of the general. Slowly, the general stars walk towards the light, and his man follows him. The general seems to be stepping further than the room's physical dimensions allow.

The light gets a bit brighter as the men disappear into the light as if the bodies of the men strengthen the light. Then the music dies down. The light eliminating what seemed to be the whole city cut out at once, and the only thing we saw was some dust settling in the now empty warehouse.

We hang a moment in utter silence to get the impact of the loss we have suffered with our victory over the general.

### heart of stone

In Heart of Stone, we see a female hacker protagonist who is secretly a super agent. During the under-cover parts, she feels slightly autistic, but when she is in her element, she is a super agent.

Also, this movie came really close to a refreshing story. (and moved away from it immediately). The main character slowly convinced this antagonistic character to join her side. And in the end, she did join the main character. In the third act, the secondary character provides a small opening, and then the main character saves the day.

Would it be cool if the main character had failed and the secondary character had saved the day? And with this, I mean that the main character has nothing to do with the final solution. In this movie specifically, the main character is driving to the final location, but she could end up in traffic. The second character had already encrypted the McGuffin, and the bad guys could not get it. So if she had just run away, the day would have been saved.
